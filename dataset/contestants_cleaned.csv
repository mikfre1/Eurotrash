Don't yawn from sleep or boredom
I'm your wife and I eat out of your hand
But I don't eat from charity
Don't look at me as if you think: 'are you still alive?'
Am I still that woman
With whom you once - when was it again? -
Wanted to have that little adventure at all costs?
Be nice once again, just like then
Ask me once again for a kiss
Bring me roses again, blush again
When you see me, just like then
Be nice and gallant once again
Find me beautiful and charming again
Then the world will be just like before
A fairyland
Yes, you're getting fat and your hair is turning grey
But you still can flirt, believe me
Ah, sometimes you act like a child, so silly
Gruff and wanton by turn
Do you remember? Do you remember? Don't say no now
Do you remember, that you said then?
The happiest couple, that's the both of us

Follow the water side
You'll see a ballroom where you could get drunk
In Lisette's clear eyes, on the pom-poms of a musette ball
Before deciding in a kiss to dare everything
Like the water flows in the fountain, this song
Is the song that girls and boys each sing their own way
It will be in everybody's hearts, that's for sure
It will be there forever – the song of the beautiful love
Let's sing it again under the lilacs and lalala here and there
It's the beautiful love
The beautiful love
However the autumn has come, the ballroom with closed shutters
Doesn't have lovers anymore, nobody comes when it's time
To dream along the water side
It's the ball of the dead leaves, which dance on the gravel
And go from door to door, taken along by the wind
Whirling by thousands, waiting for what? – For spring

And then hesitate to come back
To the eyes that tempt
And invite them to smile

And suggests something crazy to you

But so bright the light of love within me shone
I knew full well, what e'er befell, I must go on
Looking high, high, high
Looking low, low, low
Wondering why, why, why
Did she go, go, go?
For if I, I, I don't find my love, I know
I shall die, die, die 'cause I love her so
Due east over desert sands
Due west where grass is greener
I asked in a dozen lands
But none had ever seen her
It was clear, I fear, my quest was all in vain
So I departed, sad at heart, for home again
Looking high, high, high
Looking low, low, low
Wondering why, why, why
Did she go, go, go?
For if I, I, I don't find my love, I know
I shall die, die, die 'cause I love her so
But when I arrived, all brown
And tanned by wind and weather
You sure could have knocked me down
With the proverbial feather
She stood there, so fair
And sweetly she confessed
That she'd been wrong
And all along she'd loved me best
I'd looked high, high, high
I'd looked low, low, low
Wondering why, why, why
Did she go, go, go?

Some have the soft, and some have the fiery look
But if I searched in all of the most wonderful countries
I'd never find anyone so beautiful as you, Angelique
If I wore Shakespeare's poetry hat
I'd be writing poems to you day and night
And if I wore Caruso's cape
Then I'd sing and sing for you
And I'd paint you lovely and bashful
If I could paint as Rembrandt could
And I'd worship you on a violin
If I could play like Menuhin
But all the Muses said no
I don't master singing and string playing
Just let me dream a little of you, Angelique
So I feel as just a single little pawn
In the moѕаic of you life

Αναρωτιέμαι αν μία μέρα θα πεις ότι νοιάζεσαι
Αν πεις ότι με αγαπάς τρελά, θα είμαι ευχαρίστως εκεί
Σαν μια μαριονέτα σε μια χορδή
Η αγάπη είναι ακριβώς σαν ένα γαϊτανάκι
Με όλο το κέφι του πανηγυριού
Μια μέρα νιώθω πεσμένος στο έδαφος
Τότε είμαι στον αέρα
Με οδηγείς;
Αύριο, θα φύγεις;
Αναρωτιέμαι αν μία μέρα θα πεις ότι νοιάζεσαι
Αν πεις ότι με αγαπάς τρελά, θα είμαι ευχαρίστως εκεί
Σαν μια μαριονέτα σε μια χορδή
Μπορεί να κερδίσω στον κυκλικό κόμβο
Μετά θα χάσω στις κούνιες
Μέσα ή έξω, δεν υπάρχει ποτέ αμφιβολία
Απλώς ποιος τραβάει τις χορδές
Είμαι όλη δεμένη σε εσένα
Αλλά πού με οδηγεί;

And a faraway echo was talking about you
Today that you came to my life
I only sing for you

Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side

I live singing (hey), I live dreaming (hey)
But I wonder how long I could keep
Your love deep inside of me

For knights in the Knight's Hall
He sang in tough, strong language
A long and bloody story
The troubadour
But also the workmen in the barn
Heard his song full of adventure
Heard nearby the nightly kitchenfire
The troubadour, the troubadour
And in the inn of the city
He sang a drinking song on the dampness
For those who could still stand and those who sat

About a miracle that occurs
Even if nobody sees the wonder
The troubadour
Women dressed in velvet or grey
Whose hearts he sang into confusion
His love song was brought along on trips
The troubadour
He sang for farmers on the land
A fellow song he wrote himself
He was from all walks of life
The troubadour, the troubadour
Like this he sang his whole life long
His own song, his own singing
But still death just goes its way
The troubadour, the troubadour
Then it went quiet, the song was ended
Only some mud in conclusion
But those who were comforted by his song
Don't forget him

Love is a kiss as sweet as sugar
That is pushed by the lips while the eyes are shut
And while the heart beats with enthusiasm
And feels the veins burn with fire

And the hippies and I also asked them my question

And our youth which finishes today
Because I'm getting married

To think about life, to make children
To invest my savings

Tomorrow I'll be in prison
You won't see me anymore

When the world existed only in theory
And they didn't differentiate between tomorrow, the day before yesterdat and last night
There would fight where you should put the sun
But one thing was agreed upon
If the man is stubborn
No chance, no compensation
That is what happened
I gave her my life, I fell on my knees
Everyone will believe me
I learned what it was and was offended
Since then many bridges have passed over the water
And they've already had time to come up with noon
They still didn't know about the globe, what shape it was
If it's square, if it's round, or whatever he likes
But they knew one thing
And that was immediately determined
If she refused - there is no hope
That is what happened
I gave her my life, I fell on my knees
Everyone will believe me
I learned what it was and was offended
Today you will find that the topic for any debate is
What came first - the egg or the apple?
One says that the sky is running out for him
There is enough air for a country or two
Maybe we'll get along after all
She will want, then we will overcome
She denied any access
That's what happened when…
I gave her my life, I fell on my knees
Believe me, everyone, I learned what it is for nothing
I gave her my life, I fell on my knees
Believe me, everyone, I learned what it is for nothing

Cross your heart and hope to die

Όταν νιώθεις καλά, όλα είναι σφιχτά
Προσπάθησε να τραγουδήσεις ένα τραγούδι που πάει ντινγκ-α-ντονγκ
Δεν θα υπάρχει θλίψη όταν τραγουδάς αύριο
Και περπατάς μαζί με το ντινγκ-α-ντονγκ σου
Ντινγκ-α-ντονγκ κάθε ώρα, όταν μαζεύεις ένα λουλούδι
Ακόμα κι όταν ο εραστής σου φύγει, φύγει, φύγει
Ντινγκ-α-ντονγκ, άκου σε αυτό, ίσως να είναι μεγάλη επιτυχία
Ακόμα κι όταν ο εραστής σου φύγει, φύγει, φύγει

Όταν νιώθεις καλά, όλα είναι σφιχτά
Άκου για να τραγουδήσεις ένα τραγούδι που πάει ντινγκ-α-ντονγκ

Όταν τραγουδούν ένα τραγούδι που πάει ντινγκ-α-ντονγκ

Όταν νομίζεις ότι όλα έχουν τελειώσει, με απογοητεύουν
Στεγνώστε τα δάκρυά σας και ξεχάστε όλη σας τη θλίψη
Προσπάθησε να χαμογελάς όσο λες αντίο
(Ντινγκ-ντονγκ ντινγκ-ντονγκ)

Then he lifts a fiddle and bow with gentle care
And just like sunlight out of the rain, old man fiddle's come to play again
And light this night up into flame
Just his dancing fiddling bow brings to life all sleepy toes

So kiss the blues goodbye
Let the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly
Feet are dancing free in ragtime reverie
Pick up your lazy legs and give it a try
We sang along into the dawn till our cares were just memories
Danced in time to country tunes
In some valley he lives free, where his notes ripen on the trees
Underneath the harvest moon
So kiss the blues goodbye
Let the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly
Feet are dancing free in ragtime reverie
Pick up your lazy legs and give it a try
In the gentle falling rain, you could still hear the loving sound
That filled the night with memories
And when the skies are turning grey, bring him back here to play again
He'll waken blossoms on the trees

That sees the birds passing by in the distance
Like the blue bird flying over the earth
See how beautiful the world… the world is
Beautiful is the boat, dancing on the waves
Wild of life, love and wind
Beautiful is the song, coming from the waves
Abandoned to the white sand
White is the innocent, the blood from the poet
Who invents love by singing
So that life gets dressed in feast
And so that night changes to day
Day from a life when dawn breaks
To wake up the town with heavy eyes
When mornings gather the dreams
To give us a world of love
Love, it's you; love, it's me
The bird, it's you; the child, it's me
I'm just a girl of the shade
That sees the evening star shining
You, my star that forms a circle
Come to light my dark sun
Dark are the misery, the men and the war
Which believe that they hold the time's reins
The country of love doesn't have a border
For the ones who have a child's heart
Like a child with eyes full of light

Beats John Travolta in a rock 'n' roll

Practising dressage as a pastime
But when darkness falls, she's the one opting out
She demands action, it's the same every single day
What can it be that she wants?

And they play the role they have to play
They have sold their hearts to the theatre
They're standing up there and those below look at them
They're kings, beggars, clowns in the footlight
But how it looks deep inside them, you can't see
Theatre, theatre, the curtain opens
Then the stage becomes the world
Theatre, theatre, it's like an intoxication
And it's only the moment that counts
Like a burning fever, like a piece of happiness
A long forgotten dream comes back to life
Theatre, theatre, hated and loved
Heaven and hell at the same time
And the clown has to laugh, even if he wants to cry
And the audience doesn't see that a tear is rolling down
And the hero has to be strong, and fight for the right
But often he's got stage fright
Everything is just like theatre, but it's also reality
Theatre, the gateway to fantasy
Theatre, theatre, the only one who stays true
Who loves you with passion
Theatre, theatre
(And the clown has to laugh)
Is life and dream
(Even if he wants to cry)
Beginning and ending at the same time
(And the audience doesn't see that a tear is rolling down)

(And the hero has to be strong)
You give us the applause

And then begin
For example, I want to bind her hair
With a wire of the wind
For Lucia it'll be the fullest moon
But it won't be enough
To continue, I want a sea of wheat
To cherish every few
Good night, when you die
You'll wear the stars and dream
You'll have a smooth sea for sailing
And silence when you want to speak
For sensitive Lucia, I'll be her shadow
Drawn on the road
For example, I want to open for her the doors
That close the world
With Lucia I have enough
She fills you up on the emptier days
I want to give her so much again
The smile on the face which is a little tired
Beyond the wall that is there
Hold your breath and jump towards me
Rifle shots are far away
We'll open the sky with our hands
For Lucia long life and the water of a river
For every wound
I want burning lights, the biggest feast
For the whole country
For frightened Lucia, my pen
Becomes a sword

I go out to the balcony to crack open some seeds

And sing with me the bums' song

With a basket made of straw to buy me some groceries
When he comes back, I make us both lunch
Because the birds have eaten all the seeds
Suddenly I hear a ring, someone's knocking at the door
I open the door, the neighbour comes in
She asks politely, if it's no bother
To sing with me my hupa'le

To get some air in the park on the city outskirts

With yearning to be with the white angels
When the rainbow bends in the sky

Let the future belong to us
We only reap what we sow
What have we understood then, of the time that has passed?
Can the past carry the children of the future?
A century is ebbing out, a new era is knocking on our door
Has progress led us astray?
The fire of the past contains hot embers
Nature is wounded, values are at stake
Now we see all of yesterday's mistakes
But the hope has been lit, it can never be too late
For knowledge to put down roots
Which provide us with courage and a will to create
Culture is a heritage for the people of our country
A mirror of times passed by
Give us a dawn with children's laughter and song
We love our father and mother
We have love to give to our sister and brother
Give us a sunrise and let our dream be true
Together on the path of hope we walk hand in hand
We only have this earth, let tomorrow become a friend
Show love to your fellow man
And you will have honesty in return
Let big and small share the same table
In a friendship which is alive and growing

But the singing of many people hasn't lost its strength
This song is uniting and it remains for us a witness
And in every generation, the people carry a song

They made the world their country
Your grandfather was in these parts
My grandmother was here too
Our love is the entire ocean
Your perfume is moonlight
My taste is coffee
My sweetheart with white skin
You are the cream in my dark tea
It's sweeter than honey
A mixture of vanilla and chocolate
A white seagull was found
In those southern lands
Sweet and musical people
Whose tropical singing
Made the dream and the sea blue
Who flavoured our love
Made by the Spanish and Portuguese guitar
In the to-and-fro of caravels
With pepper and cinnamon
With chilli and saffron?
My sweetheart with white skin
You are the cream in my dark tea
It's sweeter than honey
A mixture of vanilla and chocolate
Who were those people who lifted anchor
And rounded Cape Bojador?
Those people who fell under the spell, the challenge
To invent a new love
When hands are joined, a flower is born
And each kiss is blissful peace

Whatever the colour of our body

When our souls feel love
Whatever the colour of our body

Here you'll feel time slower passing by
Silence and peace that we miss so much

We're small, but not necessarily bad
No borders, no flags
From up there, the world is just beautiful
No countries, no nations
No wars can be seen from up there
Everyone should go there at least once
To realise this struggle doesn't make sense
Perhaps it will take our stupid megalomania
And instead of yapping, we begin to love
No borders, no flags
No stupid quarrels, no different races
No wars, no states

When there is nothing else, I think that
I still have a song I can sing to you
About happiness we feel, about a road that goes
Like a train on metal rails
To faraway stations on the North Pole
Where freedom lives, and nothing else
Each time when I feel miracles in the distance
I want to be closer to you
Nothing, when there is nothing else
I want to sing you a song about happiness
That comes, that comes unexpectedly
And takes us by the hand
A song about happiness to come
When there is nothing else, I think that
I still have the wind that runs up to the sky
And the sun that rises, faraway roads that cross
Seven mountains and nine seas
To warmer lands like birds of passage
There everything is just like in a dream, but you are not there
Each time when I feel miracles in the distance
I want to be closer to you

Nighttime and you are the silence that remains
Falling with you for one moment at the end of the game

With dozen lonely nights in my empty bed
Waiting for your touch, drying tears instead
I can't forget them
Promises you made had no faith
You never really kept them

Where do I belong?
Was it right or wrong?

From the north to the south, all standing side by side

There you will see a strength which makes
Everything stay where it is
Irradiate peace, irradiate light
Irradiate harmony, be yourself

The beauty of life
Go and search for it inside your heart
Before you turn to the world
If you want to find
The mystery of life
Go and search for it inside your heart
Through the inner look
Open one by one the doors of the treasure
Which is hidden inside your heart, don't doubt it
Bathe in the calmness of the clear water
Where you will find the essence of the one you want to be
Look within
If you want to find
The beauty of life
Go and search for it inside your heart

The saints are crippled on this sinners' night
Lost are the lambs with no guiding light

She was so cute, her legs were so long
I went to her ballet class for almost a year

I stitched ""no, thanks"" onto my parka
She didn't care about that back then
But since then, I know who rules the world
The way they walk and stand
The way they look at you
And your wallet and heart start to open up
And you buy a ring and a mink coat
One seductive glance
And your political views start to change
It's not the boss or the action heroes
It's not the state or mafia money
Women rule the world
All the stops, from coquettish to naive
Even as babies, they had a hold on their fathers
They give everything when there's something they want
And you bang your head against a brick wall when they're sulking
You make a fool of yourself and let yourself get beaten up
Just so the girls would look over just once
They can push Beckham and overthrow Clinton
Without even having to form a party
The way they walk and stand

How they look and smile 
How they talk and while 
They are making us think that we're kings 
Guess who is really pulling the strings

Turns a no into ""I approve""

When the shadows fall, when the sunlight dies
Empty streets are filled with the pale lamplight
We are just two lonely shades walking in the night
Words lose their sense
When I feel you near, when I touch your hands
I'm trying not to think that at break of dawn
You'll be gone and I'll be lost, numb and all alone
When the morning comes, I'm all alone
Left to live another day, in joy or sadness, on my own
When the morning comes, I'm all alone
Every time at break of dawn
Weak and unwise
I betray all fears that I should disguise
Melting in your arms, I fail to realise
Why the mornings always change the colour of your eyes
When the morning comes, I'm all alone
Every time at break of dawn

Žvaigždės danguje
Kai šešėliai nukrenta, kai saulės šviesta dingsta
Tuščios gatvės pilnos blyškių lempos šviesų
Mes tik du vieniši atspalviai naktyje
Žodžiai praranda savo prasmę
Kai jaučiu tave arti, kai paliečiu tavo rankas
Aš bandau apie tai negalvoti prieš aušrą
Tu būsi dingęs ir aš būsiu pasiklydusi, sugrubusi ir visiškai viena
Kai rytas ateina, aš visiškai viena
Palikta gyventi kitą dieną, džiaugsme, liūdesyje, pati -
Kai rytas ateina, aš visiškai viena
Kiekvieną aušrą
Silpna ir neišmintinga
Aš išduodu visas baimes kurias turėčiau slėpti
Tirpstu tavo rankose, man nepavyksta suprasti
Kodėl rytai visada pakeičia tavo akių spalvą
Kai rytas ateina, aš visiškai viena
Kiekvieną aušrą
Mylėk ar išeik, aš su ir be tavęs
Kodėl aš žaidžiu šį beprotišką žaidimą
Kaip aš galiu nebegalvoti apie tave
Mylėk ar išeik, nebežaisk su mano širdimi
Mylėk ar išeik, aš su ir be tavęs
Kodėl aš žaidžiu šį beprotišką žaidimą
Kaip aš galiu nebegalvoti apie tave
Ei.. mylėk ar išeik, nebežaisk ѕu mаno širdimi

Jei liūdėsiu aš, nežinia kodėl

In heavy hands on shadowlands
As thunderclouds roll in, sunset is receding
No summer wine, no Valentine
A tiger trapped inside a cage
An actor on an empty stage
Come see the show
Rock 'n' roll can heal your soul
When broken hearts lose all control
Some rivers still run dry and jungles burn to embers
Gold autumn days must fade to grey
There is a reason why a haunted man remembers
One frozen night, his darkest day
A tiger trapped inside a cage
An actor on an empty stage
Come see the show
Rock 'n' roll will heal your soul
When broken hearts lose all control
A passion killed by acid rain
A rollercoaster in my brain
But how would you know?
In your satin, silk and lace
Another time, another place
A tiger trapped inside a cage
An actor on an empty stage
Come see the show
Rock 'n' roll will heal your soul
When broken hearts lose all control
A love let loose and painted black
A train stuck on a broken track
Well, I'll let it go
Rock 'n' roll has healed my soul

Ja mulle meeldib, et elu on kui Mehhiko seebiseriaal
Mind tõukab taganttuul ja patumaitse suus
Ma tunnen pilku, mis meelitab mind
Kui mahlane õun viljapuus
Su huultelt lugeda võin
Et algab pöörane sõit
Ja täna öösel end sinuga vaid
Saan tunda kui Bonnie ja Clyde
Meist maha jääb vaid tolm, kui stardib vana Ford
Ning hetkeks tundub sel kruusasel teel
Et aasta on kolmkümmend kolm
Su huultelt lugeda võin
Et algab pöörane sõit
Ja täna öösel end sinuga vaid
Saan tunda kui Bonnie ja Clyde
Su huultelt lugeda võin
Et algab pöörane sõit
Ja täna öösel end sinuga vaid
Saan tunda kui Bonnie ja Clyde
Ma soovin, et päike tõusma ei peaks
Ning hommik ei ärataks maad
Sinuga kaasa lollused kõik
Siis lõpuni teha ma saaks
Su huultelt lugeda võin
Et algab pöörane sõit
Ja täna öösel end sinuga vaid
Saan tunda kui Bonnie ja Clyde

Et algab pöörane sõit
Ja täna öösel end ѕinuga vaid

If someone makes an error
He's gonna blow us up
To biddy biddy kingdom come
There are some crazy rulers
They hide and try to fool us
With demonic, technologic
Willingness to harm
They're gonna push the button, push the button
Push the bu… push the bu… push the button
Push the button, push the button
Push the bu… push the bu… push the button
There's a lot of suffering
In the streets there's too much violence
And we are very lucky
To be alive, even unscathed
Tactical advancement of a fanatical regime
A tragic situation
That brings tears to my eyes
And I don't wanna die
I wanna see the flowers bloom
Don't wanna go kaput kaboom
And I don't wanna cry
I wanna have a lot of fun just sitting in the sun
But nevertheless
He's gonna push the button, push the button
Push the bu… push the bu… push the button
Push the button, push the button
Push the bu… push the bu… push the button
Messages are exploding on me
Missiles are flying are also landing on me
Cops and robbers are running all over me
And they're jumping me, getting on my case
Alas, alas, answer me, my God, hi
This nightmare is too long
When I'm barely alive and everyone is aiming at me
Maybe it's too early to sing that I gave her my life
Police, rescue team
It made it to the Kdam, a song with no peace
Red is not just a colour, it's more like blood
Again I'm stopping the breathing in my heart
So I won't drop dead
First it's a war, now it's resuscitation
Boom boom, that's what is happening now
In between a rocket and a machete, a viewer and a reporter
Underhanded opportunism and a kidnapee, rain and a heatwave
An escalation in the levels is setting up camp
Nothing, nothing, that's what everyone is doing
Hardliners become more extreme and officers more serious
The naive become more moderate, waiting for the data
And reply (that everyone is helpless)
A world full of demons
Where we are nothing but pawns
And champions with gambling chips
Decide the outcome
Sluggish management
A ship filled with water
And everyone is raising a toast
And drowning side by side
Maybe it's too sharp
We should sing songs of palm tree
Desert songs with no flags
I'm still alive, alive, alive
And if it keeps on being scary, only then will I say:

Wake the soul from its sleep, no particular order

That little lady from the suburbs
Who can read from people's palms
There the cats are hungry in the morning
After a night so full of unease
She will stroke and feed them
At night she strays, and sleeps by day
And her eyes know more than mine
I ran out of words, I just stood there
I would die with her alone
I would die with her in one day
And if that's not enough for you
If there were a hundred women there
I'd offer her a dance I can't dance myself
Behind the railway is her nest
She collects coins from fountains
And then she puts them on the tracks
She's building herself a temple, a bridge made of tin
Already being crossed by the first passenger
So that his legs won't hurt
She's been through hell and she knows the spells
She collects the trodden coins
And whoever sees her is damned
I would die with her alone
I would die with her in one day
And if that's not enough for you
If there were a hundred women there
I'd offer her a dance I can't dance myself
I will remember that instant
When she played, it sounded like Paganini
And I already knew I was damned
I asked how much, feeling guilty
I would die with her in one day
And if that's not enough for you
If there were a hundred women there

The courage that's inside's gonna break my fall
Nothing's gonna dim my light within

Άνοιξε κάθε πόρτα
Γυρίστε το αδιανόητο στην πραγματικότητα
Θα δεις, μπορώ να τα κάνω όλα και περισσότερα

Creer en algo es el secreto

Le diré que aquí ya no tiene un lugar
No permitiré que me lastimen
Voy a luchar

Dance it with Bardem, dance it with Banderas
Dance with Almodóvar, dance the Macarena

And I can tell you that between this
And a million other songs, there is no difference
For this life erases traces behind us
In the good night strange devils are released
So every dream is lit up by the cold sun
And the memories are almost all extinguished
If you ask me, just one more thing I would know
That all colours only exist with this rhyme
While the night and day are the trace of some verse
And they will disappear when all our songs vanish
Play that romance tonight
Quietly, tenderly, so it makes me ill
Sorrow when the nightingale is dying
When the soul separates from the body
Play that romance tonight
But slowly so that everyone hears it
Let the guitars play again

Technological waste like a monkey on a branch
And I was the first Internet in the world
On the ships I connected the planet with music

All the fantasies and the faces that are gone
Like shadows they are a part of my awakenings
Captured in me, interwoven a long time ago

Целый мир отдать был рад
Наверное, я был тогда другим -
Наивным до слез и смешным таким:
Верил, что тобой любим…

Я счастье догнал - а поймать не смог
Назад не мани, зря не обещай
Прощай, прощай

Время проститься с ложью
Все возвратиться может
Но не мечты
Hasta la vista! Мне бы
Взвиться, как птице, в небо
Будто и близко не был
Я там, где ты
Пусть клочья моих алых парусов
Наполнит опять новая любовь
Словно бриз иных миров
Пусть я утону - и еще не раз -
Ныряя в моря нежных женских глаз
Но - не здесь и не сейчас
Пустые слова - жемчуг под ногой:
Ведь счастлива ты будешь не со мной
Назад не мани, зря не обещай -
Прощай, прощай
Hasta la vista! Что же
Время простится с ложью
Всё возвратиться позже

אני מאוהב באגדה

כי לא אכפת לי אם אני אאבד את שפיותי

כל יום התחלנו להילחם
כל לילה התאהבנו
אף אחד אחר לא יכול היה לעשות אותי עצוב יותר
אבל אף אחד אחר לא יכול היה להרים אותי גבוה למעלה
אני לא יודע מה הייתי עושה
כשפתאום התפרקנו
היום אני לא יכול למצוא אותה
אבל מתי שאני אצליח, נתחיל מחדש לגמרי

Но никто другой не смог бы поднять меня высоко над землей

Как вдруг мы расстались
А сейчас, я не могу ее найти

At the side of a packed ring road
I see a fist out of a window

May God bless and keep my cherished fruit

He likes to sit under an apple tree on his yard
And wait for an apple to fall
When Peter is nine, his teacher tells him that this planet is dying
That someone needs to put an end to it all
And so when Peter comes home, he tells his mom:
I'm going out in the world to save our planet
And I ain't coming back until she's saved
I'll walk my way to see the king and parliament
If they don't help, I'll do it by myself
I don't wanna be…

Peter is young, he tries to talk, but no one listens to him
Everybody's busy living and dying, not thinking about what they're doing
But look at the boy who went out in the world to save our planet
And he ain't coming back until she's saved
He walked his way to see the king and parliament
But they all turned their heads and walked away, singing:
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam…
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam…
And now I'm going out in the world to save our planet
And I ain't coming back until she's saved
I'm walking in the footsteps that young Peter made
And everybody is welcome to join, and ѕing with me:

Peter er klok, han kan de europeiske landet fra minne
Han liker å sitte under et eple tre i hans hage
Og venter for et eple å falle ned
Når Peter er ni, forteller læreren hans at Planeten dør
Og at noen må sette et stop til det
Og så kommer Peter hjem, og forteller hans mor
Jeg går ut i verden for å redde planeten vår
Og jeg kommer ikke tilbake før hun er god igjen
Jeg skal gå min vei for å se Kongen og Stortinget
Vist de ikke hjelper, gjør jeg det selv
Jeg vill ikke være…

Peter er ung, han prøver å snakke, men ingen lytter på ham
Alle er opptatt med å leve og dø, men ikke hva de gjør
Men se på gutten som redder Planeten vår
Og han kommer ikke tilbake før hun er god igjen
Han gikk sin vei for å se Kongen og Stortinget
Men de alle snudde hode og gikk vekk
Mens de sang:
Da da dam, da da dam, da da da da da da, da dam
Da da dam, da da dam, da da da da da da, da dam
Og nå går jeg ut i verden for å redde planeten vår
Og jeg kommer ikke tilbake før hun er god igjen

I natt, i natt är evighet en öppen dörr
Nej, sluta aldrig göra sakerna du gör

Wanna be in the dream and have some fun

Do you wanna be more than just a friend?
Do you wanna play cybersex again?
If you wanna come to my house
Then click me with your mouse
Hello, ooh oh oh…

Meet you on the Internet!
Do you really like politics? Wanna talk about dirty tricks?
Are you really a sex machine or just some beauty queen?

Please tell me why, why do we make it so hard?
Look at us now, we only got ourselves to blame
It's such a shame
How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules?
Between us – only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right?
Between us – only teardrops
So come and face me now
Here on the stage tonight
Let's leave the past behind us
Eye for an eye, why tear each other apart?
Please tell me why, why do we make it so hard?
Look at us now, we only got ourselves to blame
It's such a shame
Tell me
How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules?
Between us – only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right between us?
Only teardrops
(Tell me now) What's gone between us has come between us

Небото е црвено вечерва
Ние сме на работ вечерва
Нема ѕвезда што паѓа да не води
Око за око, зошто да се распарчуваме?
Кажи ми зошто, зошто правиме да биде толку тешко?
Погледни нè сега, само ние сме криви
Срамота
Колку пати може да победиме и изгубиме?
Колку пати може да ги кршиме правилата?
Меѓу нас - само солзи
Колку пати мора да се бориме?
Колку пати додека да го направиме како што треба?
Меѓу нас - само солзи
Ајде дојди и соочи се со мене

Ајде да го оставиме минатото зад нас

Can we go back and freeze the moment?

Clouds have taken all the light
I have no control, it seems my
Thoughts wander all
Of the time, when I try to
Live life without you
Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hopes turned into fear and with my
One wing I can't fly
With sunrise, embrace my
Dreams tight and that's why

Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
Birds
To a place without fear, with no moonlight
(To a place without moonlight and fear)
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight

Mis pensamientos se alejan
Del momento en el que intento
Vivir la vida sin ti
Pájaros cayendo desde los tejados
Desde el cielo como gotas de lluvia
Sin aire, sin orgullo
Si ser yo misma es lo que hago mal
Entonces, preferiría no hacerlo bien
Esperanzas que se vuelven miedo y
Con mi única ala, no puedo volar
Con el amanecer, abrazo fuerte
Mis sueños, y ese es el motivo
Pájaros cayendo desde los tejados
Desde el cielo como gotas de lluvia
Sin aire, sin orgullo
Pájaros
A un lugar sin miedo, sin luz de luna

Lo único que necesito es árboles, y flores, y luz del sol

Leva livet utan dig

Ingen luft, ingen stolthet
Om att vara mig själv är vad jag gör fel
Då skulle jag hellre vara fel
Hopp omvandlas till rädsla och med min
Enda vinge, jag kan inte flyga
Med soluppgång, omfamna mina
Drömmar hårt och det är varför

Sitting in a small cafe
Feeling lonely, a little tired
I'd been working hard all day
Then a noise caught my attention
And I heard a wonderful sound
Coming at me like a tsunami
Nearly took my feet off the ground
A rush of excitement brought you to my ears
All beautiful people aha-ia ia-ia-ia…

We play-oh, we play-oh to the rhythm of a cha-cha
Solayoh, Solayoh, turn the music up, it's gonna getcha
We play-oh, we play-oh, we can make it into a hot night (Yeah)
Situation started improving
Maybe this was kismet now
And my body just started moving
I was really shaking down
Something happened when I was dancing
I could feel that powerful beat
Taking me to new dimensions
Waking up the devil in me
A heavenly chorus and love all around
All beautiful people aha-ia ia-ia-ia…

El Viernes noche parecía no ir a ninguna parte
Sentada en un pequeño café
Sintiéndome sola, un poco cansada
Llevaba trabajando mucho todo el día
Entonces, un sonido captó mi atención
Y oí un sonido maravilloso
Que me llegaba como un tsunami
Casi me levanta del suelo
Una ola de emoción os trajo a mis oídos
Vosotros, todos gente guapa aha-ia ia-ia-ia…
Solayoh, Solayoh, cuando el sol siempre brilla sobre ti
Cantamos-oh, cantamos-oh al ritmo del cha-cha
Solayo, Solayoh, sube la música, te va a atrapar
Cantamos-oh, cantamos-oh, podemos hacer que la noche sea caliente (¡Sí!)
La situación comenzó a mejorar
Quizás era el destino
Y mi cuerpo comenzó a moverse
Realmente estaba temblando
Algo sucedió cuando estaba bailando
Pude sentir ese ritmo poderoso
Un coro celestial y de amor a mi alrededor
Todos gente guapa aha-ia ia-ia-ia…

Called me from within

There's a bridge over the immensity
What am I, deep inside of me?

With a body made like this
Big eyes, colours, die living
Renewed for eternity

Always alone towards another freedom

Empty without me
You know that from the clouds
The rain will soon fall down
It happens suddenly
Wings drowned in tears that don't dry
The wind will come soon
And you fly, fly, fly away from yourself
Always alone until a reflection appears
In the mirror that steals the image
In thousand pieces of vertigo
And light will shine
How much life is there?
I've never noticed it
And if you still don't know it
The universe, it's us
Fly, may the strength come
Never alone again, towards another freedom

The chrysalis and even more

Counting mile marker signs
The empty seat beside me
Keeps you on my mind
Livin' in the heartache
Was never something I pursued
I can't keep on chasing
What I can't be for you
Oooohhhh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm
Tears on the highway
Water in my eyes
This rain ain't gonna change us
So what's the use to cry
I could say I'm sorry
But I don't wanna lie
I just wanna know if staying
Is better than goodbye
Oooohhhh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm
Oooooohh after all that we've been through
(baby) there ain't nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm
Maybe I can find you
Down this broken line
Maybe you can find me
Guess we'll know in time

Here in the calm аfter the ѕtorm
Rijden op de fast lane
Tellen van de kilometer markers
De lege stoel naast mij
Laat me steeds aan je denken
Leven in verdriet
Is nooit iets geweest waar ik naar op zoek was
Ik kan niet blijven achtervolgen
Wat ik niet voor jou kan zijn
Oooohhhh de hemel is zwart en blauw
Ik denk aan jou
Hier in de rust na de storm
Tranen op de snelweg
Water in mijn ogen
Deze regen zal ons niet veranderen
Wat is het nut van huilen
Ik kan mijn spijt uiten
Maar Ik wil niet liegen
Ik wil alleen weten of ik blijf
Beter dan een afscheid
Oooohhhh de hemel is zwart en blauw
Ik denk aan jou
Hier in de rust na de storm
Oooooooohh na alles wat we hebben meegemaakt
(Mijn liefde) er is niets nieuws
Hier in de rust na de storm
Misschien kan ik je vinden
Aan het einde van deze stippellijn
Misschien kun je me vinden
We zullen het op een dag ontdekken

Roulant sur la voie rapide
Comptant les bornes kilométriques
Ce siège vide à côté de moi
Me fait sans cesse penser à toi
Vivre dans le chagrin
N'a jamais été quelque chose que j'ai recherché
Je ne peux pas continuer à courir après
Ce que je ne peux pas être pour toi
Oooohhhh le ciel est noir et bleu
Je pense à toi
Ici dans le calme après la tempête
Des larmes sur l'autoroute
De l'eau dans mes yeux
Cette pluie ne va pas nous changer
A quoi ça sert de pleurer
Je pourrais faire part de mon regret
Mais je ne veux pas mentir
Je veux seulement savoir si rester
Est mieux qu'un adieu

Open up ,
You never know what you will find
You never know what waits inside
So, live
Like you'll never stop
Take this chance
And give it everything you've got
Come on and let the rhythm drop
We're dancing in the rain

Keep on till the light of day

Am I human?
What am I?
An emotion?
Time and space can lie to us while we sleep
Lovers cry, parents tremble
While you and I show our devils
The world can play a joke on each of us anytime
Mercy
I have no feelings of mercy
Destiny left me so empty
Empty in my heart and my spirit
My patience
Fighting with our indifference
Fighting to win over everything that we are and can be
Selfishness
Takes the trophies
Honesty
Wins the glories
All the masks we have are meant to make us free
Wounded pride kills our feeling
While you and I need the dreaming
The world can throw a dice for each of us anytime

Se gana la gloria

Mu silmad olid suletud, kuid olin ärkvel
Teesklesin sügava une hingamist
Riietusin vaikselt
Mind ehmatas võtmeklõbin lukuaugus
Kui astusin õue, naeratasin koerale
Ma ei tahtnud sind äratada
Minu armastusest poleks sulle nagunii piisanud
Seega võtsin asjad ja kadusin sul jalust
Miks sa mind ei äratanud
Olen kindel, et oleksin sind peatanud
Öelnud sulle, et proovime veel
Ja ütleme hüvasti eilsele
Miks sa üldse mõtled nii
Jah, me tülitseme palju, aga lõppude lõpuks
Sobime me suurepäraselt
Ma ei sooviksi midagi muud
Nüüd olen üksi ja sind ei ole
Alasti lebades vaatan oma telefoni
Ma ei tahtnud sind äratada

Я проснулся в шесть утра
Мои глаза закрыты, но разум не дремал
Притворно продолжая быть в глубокой фазе сна
Оделся достаточно быстро
Замерзшими руками взял ключи от двери
И выйдя на улицу, улыбнулся собаке
Я не хотел разбудить тебя
Моей любви все равно не хватало
Поэтому я собрал вещи и освободил тебе путь, девочка
Почему ты не разбудил меня?
Я почти уверена, мы могли остановиться
Давай начнем все заново и скажем
Прощай, вчерашний день
Почему ты так подумал?
Да, мы много боролись, но в конце концов
Мы с тобой - идеальная пара
Мне не нужен никто другой
Но, как бы то ни было, ты ушел и я одна
Лежу в своей постели голая, уткнувшись в телефон
Я не хотел разбудить тебя
Моей любви нам все равно не хватит
Поэтому я собрал вещи и освободил тебе путь, девочка
Но почему ты не разбудил меня?
Я почти уверена, мы могли остановиться
Давай начнем все заново и скажем Прощай
Прощай, вчерашний день
Я не хотел разбудить тебя
Моей любви все равно не хватит
Поэтому я собрал вещи и освободил тебе путь, девочка
Почему ты не разбудил меня?

Прощай, вчерашний день
Прощай вчерашний день
О-о, прощай вчерашний день…
Me levanté a las seis de la mañana
Mis ojos estaban cerrados, pero mi mente estaba despierta
Fingía respirar en una fase de sueño profundo
Me vestí tan rápido
Quede congelado por el sonido de mis llaves en la puerta
Mientras salía, sonreí al perro
No te quise despertar
Mi amor nunca iba a ser suficiente
Así que cogí mis cosas y me aparté de tu camino, chica
¿Por qué no me despertaste?
Estoy segura de que te habría dicho que pararas
Intentémoslo de nuevo y digamos adiós
Adiós al ayer
¿Porque pensarías así?
Sí, peleamos mucho, pero al fin y al cabo
Tú y yo, somos la pareja perfecta
Las cosas me gustaban tal y como eran
Pero ahora no estás y estoy sola
Tumbada desnuda y mirando mi teléfono
No te quise despertar
Mi amor nunca iba a ser suficiente
Así que cogí mis cosas y me aparté de tu camino, chica
¿Por qué no me despertaste?
Estoy segura de que te habría dicho que pararas
Intentémoslo de nuevo y digamos adiós

Jag vaknade klockan 6 på morgonen
Mina ögon var stängda, men mitt sinne var vaket
Låtsades som om jag andades i en djupsömnstakt
Klädde på mig så tyst
Jag frös till av skramlandet från mina nycklar vid dörren
Medans jag gick ut log jag mot hunden
Jag vill inte väcka dig
Min kärlek skulle aldrig vara nog
Så jag tog mina saker och drog iväg nu, tjejen
Varför väckte du inte mig?
Jag är rätt så säker på att jag hade bett dig att stanna
Låt oss försöka på nytt och säga farväl
Farväl till gårdagen
Varför skulle du tänka så?
Ja, vi bråkar mycket, men i slutändan
Var du och jag en perfekt matchning
Jag hade inte velat ha det på något annat vis
Men nu är du borta och jag är helt ensam
Ligger här naken och glor på mobilen
Jag vill inte väcka dig
Min kärlek skulle aldrig vara nog
Så jag tog mina saker och drog iväg nu, tjejen

Я совершил что-то ужасное, будучи юнцом
Мой разум помутнен, а контроль потерян
Я был мальчишкой, я ничего не понимал

Я освобожу тебя, но откажусь
Помашу рукой, крикну ""Прощай"", чтобы ты продолжила жить

Ты нажал на курок ружья правды
Обними меня, ведь я выгораю
Спою эту чудесную песню, попробуй остановить все это

Powiedziałeś, że nigdy mnie nie zostawisz

A ja powiedziałam, że mogę, ale teraz wiemy

So light up the candles
Let's illuminate the night
Just light up the candles
Let Them shine on deep inside
Build a chain of light for you 
And a chain of light for me
And believe that we can change reality
We've only got one life
So let's try to make our dreams survive
Maybe we'll find out that many people feel the same – oh yeah
One's a lonely number – but together
We can make a million candles 
Shine forever
Let us build a chain of hearts
In a world that's blue and dark
So light up the candles
Let's illuminate the night
An' together hand in hand
We will feel the love inside
Build a chain of love for you
(chain of love for you)
And a chain of love for me
(chain of love for me)
We will let our vision change reality
If we all light a candle
We could build a chain of light
If we all walk together
We will feel the love inside
It's a chain of hearts for you
Chain of hearts for you
And a chain of hearts for me
Chain of hearts for me
Let's create a world that's human, fair and bright

Сделали верный навстречу шаг

Каждый сбросит свою маску

Это просто страх быть особенным
Нет нужного места и времени
Чтобы понять себя
Ты - настоящий, это скрыто внутри

Давай слухати та чути справжню суть тиші

Час віднайти істину, виступити проти брехні
Час подасть нам знак
Він може пообіцяти, що це наш час сяяти
Просто вислухай, подивись навколо
Годі сумувати за тим, чого ти не віднайшов
Ти зрозумієш, що немає нічого спільного
Немає компромісу між часом та звуком

Someone sings loudly, someone screams ""Death""
In London it always rains, but today it isn't painful
The sky makes no exception, even for a funeral
In Nice, the sea is red with fire and shame
Of people on asphalt and blood in the sewer

Wounded to its core from Asia to England
Galaxies of people lost in space

Of mothers without children, children without fathers

Churches and mosques, imams and all the priests
Separate entrances to the same house
Billions of people hoping for something
Arms without hands, faces without names

Because our lives are not a point of view
And a pacifist bomb doesn't exist

Они делают это место нашим новым домом
Есть причины, которые я не забуду
И впишу их в нашу песню

For sure she had a reason, there was nothing to lose

I am all those children
Who were taken by the sea
I'll live a hundred thousand years

A blue immensity, maybe infinite
But yes, we knew the price
Emerging from a wave, there's a friendly ship
It gave again its luck to our survival

But I already left a thousand times
I've won my fights
Nobody new nothin' about
All alone
Trapped in a void
Can't see the light
Goodbye
Why don't you see the beauty that surrounds you everywhere
Why can't you feel the joy in all the small things people share
And all the happiness that by the way is all for free
Open your heart, recieve the love and stay with me
Please
Don't be afraid
I hear your cry
Don't cry
We should all see the beauty of the precious gifts we have
'Cause everyone deserves the power to go straight ahead
Never give up, don't hit the floor, don't trust in all the lies
No matter what the odds will bring you, please don't ѕаy goodbye

Ma kandsin seda, kandsin seda, kandsin seda koju
Ma kardan kõike, mis ma olen
Mu meel tundub nagu võõras maa
Vaikus heliseb mu peas
Palun, kanna mind, kanna mind, kanna mind koju
Ma kulutasin kogu armastuse, mida olin säästnud
Me olime alati kaotav mäng
Väikelinna poiss suures arkaadis
Ma jäin sõltuvusse kaotavast mängust
Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
Kõik, mida ma tean, kõik, mida ma tean
Sind armastada on kaotav mäng
Mitu penni on mänguautomaadis?
Meist loobumine ei nõudnud palju
Ma nägin lõppu enne, kui see algas
Ometi ma kandsin, kandsin, kandsin edasi
Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
Kõik, mida ma tean, kõik, mida ma tean
Sind armastada on kaotav mäng
Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh

Ma ei vaja sinu mänge, mäng on läbi
Vii mind maha sellest ameerika mäest

כל שנותר הוא לב שבור
אני עדיין מחבר את כל הסדקים
איבדתי כמה חלקים
כשלקחתי, לקחתי, לקחתי אותם הביתה
אני מפחד מעצמי
נפשי נדמית כמו מקום זר
שתיקה רועמת בתוך ראשי
אנא, קח אותי, קח אותי, קח אותי הביתה
בזבזתי את כל האהבה ששמרתי
תמיד שיחקנו בהפסד מראש
ילד מעיירה קטנה במכונת משחק גדולה
והתמכרתי להפסד
אהה
אוו
כל מה שאני יודע, כל מה שאני יודע
לאהוב אותְךָ זה משחק אבוד
כמה אסימונים נותרו בחריץ?
לא נדרש הרבה כדי לוותר עלינו
ראיתי את הסוף כבר לפני ההתחלה
ועדיין המשכתי, המשכתי, המשכתי

לאהוב אותְךָ זה משחק אבוד

Et knust hjerte er alt igjen
Jeg fikser enda alle sprekkene
Mista noen bitter når
Jeg berte, berte, berte det hjem
Jeg er redd for alt jeg er
Hjernen min følels som en ukjent land
Stillhet ringer i hodet mitt
Vær så snill, bær meg, bær meg, bær meg hjem
Jeg brukte alt kjærlighet jeg sparte
Vi var alltid en tapene spill
Liten bygd-gutt i en stor spillhall
Jeg ble avhengig av en tapene spill
Aaa, aaa
Ååå, ååå
Alt jeg vet, alt jeg vet
Elske deg er en tapene spill
Hvor mye mynter i sporet
Gi oss opp tok ikke mye
Jeg så slutten før det begynte
Fortsatt holte, holte, holte jeg på
Aaa, aaa

Alt jeg vet, alt jeg vet
Elske deg er en tapene spill

Złamane serce to jedyne co pozostało
Wciąż naprawiam wszystkie pęknięcia
Straciłem kilka kawałków kiedy
Nosiłem to, Nosiłem to, Zaniosłem to do domu
Boje się wszystkiego czym jestem
Mój umysł czuje się jak obca ziemia
Cisza dzwoni wewnątrz mojej głowy
Proszę, nieś mnie, nieś mnie, nieś mnie do domu
Wydałem całą miłość którą zaoszczędziłem
Byliśmy zawsze przegraną grą
Chłopak z małego miasteczka w wielkim salonie gier
Uzależniłem się od przegranej gry
Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
Wszystko co wiem, wszystko co wiem
Kochanie ciebie jest przegraną grą
Ile groszy w szczelinie
Rezygnacja z nas nie wzięła dużo
Zobaczyłem koniec zanim to się zaczeło
Wciąż Nosiłem to, Nosiłem to, Noszę to

Kochanie ciebie jest przegraną grą

O inimă frântă este tot ce a rămas
Încă repar toate crăpăturile
Am pierdut câteva bucăți când
Am dus-o, am dus-o, am dus-o acasă
Mi-e frică de tot ce sunt
Mintea mea se simte ca un tărâm străin
Liniștea răsună în capul meu
Te rog, du-mă, du-mă, du-mă acasă
Am cheltuit toată dragostea pe care am salvat-o
Am fost mereu un joc pierzător
Băiat dintr-un orășel într-o mare arcadă
M-am adictat la un joc pierzător
Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
Tot ce știu, tot ce știu
Să te iubesc este un joc pierzător
Câte monede în aparat?
Nu a fost greu să ne lăsăm
Am văzut sfârșitul înainte să înceapă

Разбитое сердце - это все, что у меня осталось
Я все еще пытаюсь заделать все трещины
Я потерял пару осколков, когда
Я нес это, нес, нес домой
Я боюсь всего, что я есть на самом деле
Мой разум словно в чужой стране
В моей голове звенящая тишина
Пожалуйста, отнеси меня, отнеси меня, отнеси меня домой
Я потратил всю любовь, которую накопил
Мы всегда проигрывали в этой игре
Парень из маленького городка в большой аркаде
Я пристрастился к проигрышной игре
Ааа, ааа
Оооо, оооо
Все, что я знаю, все, что я знаю
Любить тебя - это проигрышная игра
Сколько монет в автомате?
Отказаться от нас было несложно
Я увидел конец еще до того, как это началось
И все же я продолжал, я продолжал, я продолжал жить дальше
Ааа, ааа
Ооо, ооо
Все, что я знаю, все, что я знаю
Любить тебя - это проигрышная игра
Ааа, ааа
Ооо, ооо
Все, что я знаю, все, что я знаю
Любить тебя - это проигрышная игра
Мне не нужны твои игры, игра окончена
Вытащи меня с этих американских горок
Ааа, ооо
Ооо, ооо
Все, что я знаю, все, что я знаю
Любить тебя - это проигрышная игра
Ааа, ааа
Ооо, ооо

Любить тебя - это проигрышная игра
Un corazón roto es todo lo que queda
Sigo arreglando todas las grietas
Perdí un par de piezas cuando
Lo llevé, lo llevé, lo llevé a casa
Tengo miedo de todo lo que soy
Mi mente se siente como un país extranjero
El silencio resuena dentro de mi cabeza
Por favor, llévame, llévame, llévame a casa
Gasté todo el amor que ahorré
Siempre fuimos un juego perdido
Chico de un pueblo pequeño en una gran sala de juegos
Me volví adicto a un juego perdido

Unanständig tanzen
Oh, jetzt zündet sie das Feuer an
Wir werden wild wie ein Tier
Alles aufs Ganze, wir werden es ausschwitzen
Werden chaotisch, chaotisch
Verdrehen die Köpfe und drehen auf
Brechen Genicke, sie bringt die Becher
Sieh sie dir an, ich kann nicht genug kriegen
Ich werde chaotisch, chaotisch
Sie hat ihren Körper sprechen lassen
Sie brachte die Party zum Aufhören
Sie wurde ungezogen, ja
Hat es fallen und fallen lassen
Wenn sie tief sinkt, wenn sie tief sinkt
Sinkt sie so tief, sinkt sie so tief
Oh, sie weiss das, oh
Oh, sie weiss, sie lässt mich unanständig tanzen
Wenn sie tief sinkt, wenn sie tief sinkt
Sinkt sie so tief, sinkt sie so tief
Oh, sie weiss das, oh
Oh, sie weiss, sie lässt mich unanständig tanzen
Unanständig tanzen
Unanständig tanzen
Unanständig tanzen
Alle Jungs gehen jo-jo-jo
Alle Mädels gehen jo-jo-jo
Alle gehen jo-jo-jo
Sie lässt uns unanständig tanzen
Wenn sie tief sinkt, wenn sie tief sinkt
Sinkt sie so tief, sinkt sie so tief
Oh, sie weiss das, oh
Oh, sie weiss, sie lässt mich unanständig tanzen
Sie lässt uns unanständig tanzen
Unanständig tanzen
Oh, sie lässt mich, lässt mich, lässt mich unanständig tanzen
Ja, sie lässt mich, lässt mich, lässt mich unanständig tanzen
Wenn sie tief sinkt, wenn sie tief sinkt
Sinkt sie so tief, sinkt sie so tief
Oh, sie weiss das, oh
Oh, sie weiss, sie lässt mich unanständig tanzen, unanѕtändig tаnzen
Την πρόσεξα όταν ήρθε
Μοιάζει με κάποια που θα αρέσει στη μαμά
Αλλά η μαμά δεν είναι εδώ απόψε
Γίνεται άτακτη, άτακτη
Όταν μύρισε παντού το άρωμά της
Έκανε όλο το μέρος να εξαφανιστεί
Βράδυ Δευτέρας και βράδυ Παρασκευής
Γίνεται άτακτη, άτακτη
Αφήνει το σώμα της να μιλήσει
Κάνει το πάρτι να σταματήσει
Γίνεται άτακτη, ναι
Πέφτει και πέφτει χαμηλά
Όταν πηγαίνει χαμηλά, όταν πηγαίνει χαμηλά
Πηγαίνει τόσο χαμηλά, πηγαίνει τόσο χαμηλά
Ω, ξέρει ω
Ω, ξέρει ότι με κάνει να χορεύω πρόστυχα
Όταν πηγαίνει χαμηλά, όταν πηγαίνει χαμηλά
Πηγαίνει τόσο χαμηλά, πηγαίνει τόσο χαμηλά
Ω, ξέρει ω
Ω, ξέρει ότι με κάνει να χορεύω πρόστυχα
Χορεύω πρόστυχα
Χορεύω πρόστυχα
Χορεύω πρόστυχα
Ω, ανάβει τη φωτιά τώρα
Θα αγριέψουμε, όπως τα ζώα
Όλα μέσα, θα ιδρώσουμε
Γινόμαστε άτακτοι, άτακτοι
Γυρνάν κεφάλια και εμφανίζεται
Σπάνε λαιμοί, φέρνει κύπελλα
Κοίτα την, δεν μπορώ να τη χορτάσω
Γινόμαστε άτακτοι, άτακτοι
Αφήνει το σώμα της να μιλήσει
Κάνει το πάρτι να σταματήσει
Γίνεται άτακτη, ναι
Πέφτει και πέφτει χαμηλά
Όταν πηγαίνει χαμηλά, όταν πηγαίνει χαμηλά
Πηγαίνει τόσο χαμηλά, πηγαίνει τόσο χαμηλά
Ω, ξέρει ω
Ω, ξέρει ότι με κάνει να χορεύω πρόστυχα
Όταν πηγαίνει χαμηλά, όταν πηγαίνει χαμηλά
Πηγαίνει τόσο χαμηλά, πηγαίνει τόσο χαμηλά
Ω, ξέρει ω
Ω, ξέρει ότι με κάνει να χορεύω πρόστυχα
Χορεύω πρόστυχα
Χορεύω πρόστυχα
Χορεύω πρόστυχα
Όλα τα αγόρια είναι σε φάση γιο-γιο-γιο
Όλα τα κορίτσια είναι σε φάση γιο-γιο-γιο
Όλοι είναι σε φάση γιο-γιο-γιο
Μας έκανε να χορεύουμε πρόστυχα
Όταν πηγαίνει χαμηλά, όταν πηγαίνει χαμηλά
Πηγαίνει τόσο χαμηλά, πηγαίνει τόσο χαμηλά
Ω, ξέρει ω
Ω, ξέρει ότι με κάνει να χορεύω πρόστυχα

Πηγαίνει τόσο χαμηλά, πηγαίνει τόσο χαμηλά
Ω, ξέρει ω
Ω, ξέρει ότι με κάνει να χορεύω πρόστυχα, χορεύω πρόστυχα
L'ho notata quando è arrivata
La tipica ragazza che piace alla mamma
Ma la mamma, non è qui stasera
Diventa chiassoso, chiassoso
Quando emana un po' di profumo
Tutto il posto si scatena
Lunedì sera e venerdì sera
Diventa chiassoso, chiassoso
Lei lascia che il suo corpo parli
Riesce a far finire la festa
Diventa impertinente, sì
Mentre scende scende gìù
Quando si abbassa, quando si abbassa
Si abbassa di molto, si abbassa di molto
Oh, lo sa oh
Oh, lo sa che mi fa ballare indecentemente
Quando si abbassa, quando si abbassa
Si abbassa di molto, si abbassa di molto
Oh, lo sa oh
Oh, lo sa che mi fa ballare indecentemente
Ballare indecentemente
Ballare indecentemente
Ballare indecentemente
Oh, ora sta per accendere il fuoco
Stiamo per diventare matti, come degli animali
Tutti qui, stiamo per sudare
Diventa chiassoso, chiassoso
Girando le teste e accendendoci
Rompendo colli, lei porta i drink
Guardala, non ne ho abbastanza
Diventa chiassoso, chiassoso
Lei lascia che il suo corpo parli
Riesce a far finire la festa
Diventa impertinente, sì
Mentre scende scende gìù
Quando si abbassa, quando si abbassa
Si abbassa di molto, si abbassa di molto
Oh, lo sa oh
Oh, lo sa che mi fa ballare indecentemente
Quando si abbassa, quando si abbassa
Si abbassa di molto, si abbassa di molto
Oh, lo sa oh

Ballare indecentemente
Tutti i ragazzi vanno, yo-yo-yo

Oh, lo sa che mi fa ballare indecentemente
Mi fa ballare indecentemente
Ballare indecentemente
Oh, mi fa ballare indecentemente
Sì, mi fa, mi fa, mi fa, ballare indecentemente
Quando si abbassa, quando si abbassa
Si abbassa di molto, si abbassa di molto
Oh, lo sa oh
Oh, lo ѕa che mi fa ballаre indecentemente
Jeg la merke til henne da hun kom inn
Litt sånn dame som mødre liker
Men mamma, hun er ikke her i kveld
Blir rampete, rampete
Da hun helte ut litt krydder
Tok hun all stemningen til hele stedet
Mandag kveld og fredag kveld
Blir rampete, rampete
Hun lar kroppen sin snakke

Får hoder til å snu seg når hun kommer
Knekker nakker, hun har med seg mugger
Se på henne, får ikke nok
Blir rampete, rampete
Hun lar kroppen sin snakke
Hun får festen til å stanse
Hun blir frekk, yeah
Går lenger og lenger ned

Dostrzegłem ją, kiedy przybyła
Jakby dama, jaką mama lubi
Ale mama, jej nie ma wieczorem
Robi się głośno, głośno
Gdy wypuściła z siebie trochę pikanterii
Całe to miejsce ma klimat
Poniedziałkowa noc i Piątkowy wieczór
Robi się głośno, głośno
Pozwoliła ciału mówić
Sprawia, że impreza przystaje
Robi się niegrzeczna, taaa…
Opuszcza, opuszcza to w dół
Gdy schodzi nisko, schodzi nisko
Tuż przy ziemi, tuż przy ziemi
Oh, ona wie oh
Oh, ona wie, przyłapała mnie tańcząc sprośnie
Gdy schodzi nisko, schodzi nisko
Tuż przy ziemi, tuż przy ziemi
Oh, ona wie oh
Oh, ona wie, przyłapała mnie tańcząc sprośnie
Tańcząc sprośnie
Tańcząc sprośnie
Tańcząc sprośnie
Oh, teraz rozpala ogień
Będziemy dzicy, jak zwierzę
Na całość, wypoćmy to
Robi się głośno, głośno
Obracamy głowy i rozkręcamy się
Łamiemy karki, a ona przynosi filiżanki
Spójrz na nią, ciągle jej mało
Robi się głośno, głośno
Pozwoliła ciału mówić
Sprawia, że impreza przystaje
Robi się niegrzeczna, taaa…
Opuszcza, opuszcza to w dół
Gdy schodzi nisko, schodzi nisko
Tuż przy ziemi, tuż przy ziemi
Oh, ona wie oh
Oh, ona wie, przyłapała mnie tańcząc sprośnie
Gdy schodzi nisko, schodzi nisko
Tuż przy ziemi, tuż przy ziemi
Oh, ona wie oh

Tańcząc sprośnie
Tańcząc sprośnie
Tańcząc sprośnie
Chłopaki dawajcie, yo-yo-yo
Dziewczyny dawajcie, yo-yo-yo
Wszyscy dajecie, yo-yo-yo
Przyłapała nas tańcząc sprośnie
Gdy schodzi nisko, schodzi nisko
Tuż przy ziemi, tuż przy ziemi
Oh, ona wie oh
Oh, ona wie, przyłapała mnie tańcząc sprośnie
Tańcząc brudno
Oh, przyłapała mnie tańcząc
Taa, przyłapała mnie, ma mnie, ma mnie, tańczącego sprośnie
Gdy schodzi nisko, schodzi nisko
Tuż przy ziemi, tuż przy ziemi
Oh, ona wie oh
Oh, ona wie, przyłapała mnie tańcząc sprośnie, tаńcząc ѕprośnie
Am remarcat că a venit
Genul de domnișoară căreia mamei îi place
Dar mama nu e în seara asta aici
Ia-o ca pe o obișnuință
Când și-a turnat pe gât puțin condiment
Face întreg loc să aibă un vibe
De luni seară până vineri seară
Ia-o ca pe o obișnuință
Își lasă corpul să vorbească
Face petrecerea să se oprească
Devine obraznică,da
Scap-o,scap-o jos
Când vine încet,când vine încet
Vine atât de încet , vine atât de încet
O , ea știe
O , ea știe că mă face să dansez murdar
Când vine încet,când vine încet
Vine atât de încet , vine atât de încet
O , ea știe
O , ea știe că mă face să dansez murdar
Să dansez murdar
Să dansez murdar
Să dansez murdar
O,ea aprinde focul acum
Suntem sălbatici , precum niște animale
Toți începem să transpirăm
Ia-o ca pe o obișnuință
Ridică-ți capul și ține-l sus
Își rupe gâtul pentru a lua pahare
Uită-te la ea , nu poate să aibă mai mult
Ia-o ca pe o obișnuință
Își lasă corpul să vorbească
Face petrecerea să se oprească
Devine obraznică,da
Scap-o,scap-o jos
Când vine încet,când vine încet
Vine atât de încet , vine atât de încet
O , ea știe
O , ea știe că mă face să dansez murdar
Când vine încet,când vine încet
Vine atât de încet , vine atât de încet

Toți băieții fac , yo-yo-yo
Toate fetele fac , yo-yo-yo
Fiecare face , yo-yo-yo
Ne face să dansăm murdar
Când vine încet,când vine încet
Vine atât de încet , vine atât de încet
O , ea știe

Я заметил её, когда она приехала
Такая девушка, которая понравилась бы маме
Но мамы нет здесь нет этой ночью
Становимся хулиганами, хулиганами
Когда она высыпала немного перчинки
Выбила всех здесь из атмосферы
Ночь понедельника и ночь пятницы
Становимся хулиганами, хулиганами
Она позволяет своему телу разговаривать
Она заставляет вечеринку остановиться
Она становится проказницей, да
Опускаясь ниже и ниже
Когда она опустилась вниз, когда она опустилась вниз
Она опустилась так низко, так низко
О, она знает, о
О, она знает, она заставила меня грязно танцевать
Когда она опустилась вниз, когда она опустилась вниз
Она опустилась так низко, так низко
О, она знает, о
О, она знает, она заставила меня грязно танцевать
Грязно танцевать
Грязно танцевать
Грязно танцевать
О, она разжигает огонь
Мы дичаем, как животные
Ва-банк, мы выжмем из себя весь пот
Становимся хулиганами, хулиганами
Поворачиваем головы и находим её
Ломаем шеи, она приносит стаканы
Посмотри на неё, нельзя насытиться
Становимся хулиганами, хулиганами
Она позволяет своему телу разговаривать
Она заставляет вечеринку остановиться
Она становится проказницей, да
Опускаясь ниже и ниже
Когда она опустилась вниз, когда она опустилась вниз
Она опустилась так низко, так низко
О, она знает, о
О, она знает, она заставила меня грязно танцевать
Когда она опустилась вниз, когда она опустилась вниз
Она опустилась так низко, так низко
О, она знает, о
О, она знает, она заставила меня грязно танцевать
Грязно танцевать
Грязно танцевать
Грязно танцевать
Все парни: ""йо-йо-йо""
Все девушки: ""йо-йо-йо""
Все ""йо-йо-йо""
Она заставила нас грязно танцевать
Когда она опустилась вниз, когда она опустилась вниз
Она опустилась так низко, так низко
О, она знает, о
О, она знает, она заставила меня грязно танцевать
Она заставила меня грязно танцевать
Грязно танцевать
О, она заставила меня грязно танцевать
Да, она заставила меня, заставила меня, заставила меня, грязно танцевать
Когда она опустилась вниз, когда она опустилась вниз
Она опустилась так низко, так низко
О, она знает, о
О, она знает, она заставила меня грязно танцевать, грязно танцевать
Спазио сам је кад је стигла
Тип даме коју мама воли
Али мама, она није овде вечерас
Мангупирам се, мангупирам
Када је одлучила да мало зачини ствари
Довела је цело место до лудила
Понедељак вече и петак вече
Мангупирам се, мангупирам
Пустила је да њено тело прича
Учинила је да журка стане
Постаје неваљала, да
Спушта се, спушта се ниже
Када се спусти, када се спусти
Толико се спусти, толико се спусти
О, она зна, о
О, она зна да ме хвата на прљави плес
Када се спусти, када се спусти
Толико се спусти, толико се спусти
О, она зна, о
О, она зна да ме хвата на прљави плес
Прљави плес
Прљави плес
Прљави плес
О, она пали ватру сада
Дивљамо, попут животиње
Све дајем, сав зној ће изаћи из мене
Мангупирам се, мангупирам
Окреће главу и преврће се
Ломи вратове, доноси чаше
Погледајте је, не може ми бити доста ње
Мангупирам се, мангупирам
Пустила је да њено тело прича
Учинила је да журка стане
Постаје неваљала, да
Спушта се, спушта се ниже
Када се спусти, када се спусти
Толико се спусти, толико се спусти
О, она зна, о
О, она зна да ме хвата на прљави плес
Када се спусти, када се спусти
Толико се спусти, толико се спусти
О, она зна, о
О, она зна да ме хвата на прљави плес
Прљави плес
Прљави плес
Прљави плес
Сви момци крећу, јо јо јо
Све девојке крећу, јо јо јо
Сви крећу, јо јо јо
Она нас хвата на прљави плес
Када се спусти, када се спусти
Толико се спусти, толико се спусти
О, она зна, о
О, она зна да ме хвата на прљави плес
Хвата ме на прљави плес
Прљави плес
О, она ме хвата на прљави плес
Да, хвата ме, хвата, хвата на прљави плес
Када се спусти, када се спусти
Толико се спусти, толико се спусти
О, она зна, о
О, она зна да ме хвата на прљави плес, прљави плес
La noté cuando llegó
Como una dama la mamá
Pero mamá, ella no está aquí esta noche
Teniendo un alboroto, alboroto
Cuando derramó la especia
Tengo todo el lugar sin ambiente
Lunes en la noche y la noche del viernes
Teniendo un alboroto, alboroto
Deja que su cuerpo hable
Hace que la fiesta pare
Se está poniendo traviesa, yeah
Soltándolo y dejándolo caer
Cuando ella baja, cuando ella baja
Ella va tan abajo, van tan abajo
Oh, ella sabe oh
Oh, ella sabe que me tiene bailando sucio
Cuando ella baja, cuando ella baja
Ella va tan abajo, van tan abajo
Oh, ella sabe oh
Oh, ella sabe que me tiene bailando sucio
Bailando sucio
Bailando sucio
Bailando sucio
Oh, ella enciende el fuego ahora
Estamos volviéndonos salvajes, como animales
A todo, vamos a sudar
Teniendo un alboroto, un alboroto
Volteando cabezas hacia arriba
Rompiendo cuellos, ella trae copas
Mírala, no tiene suficiente
Teniendo un alboroto, alboroto
Deja que su cuerpo hable
Hace que la fiesta pare
Se está poniendo traviesa, yeah
Soltándolo y dejándolo caer
Cuando ella baja, cuando ella baja
Ella va tan abajo, va tan abajo
Oh, ella sabe oh
Oh, ella sabe que me tiene bailando sucio
Cuando ella baja, cuando ella baja
Ella va tan abajo, va tan abajo
Oh, ella sabe oh

Todos los chicos van, yo-yo-yo
Todas las chicas van, yo-yo-yo
Todos van, yo-yo-yo
Nos tiene bailando sucio

Yeah, me tiene, me tiene, me tiene, bailando sucio
Cuando ella baja, cuando ella baja
Ella va tan abajo, va tan abajo
Oh, ella sabe oh
Oh, ella sabe que me tiene bailando sucio, bailаndo ѕucio
Ulaştığında, onu fark ettim
Anne gibi bir hanımefendi
Ama anne, o bu gece burada değil
Kabadayılaştıkça, kabadayılaştıkça
O küçük baharat gibi dışa döküldükçe
O mekan dışında tüm yere sahip olmak
Pazar gecesi ve Cuma gecesi
Kabadayılaştıkça, kabadayılaştıkça
O bedeninin konuşmasına izin verir
O partiyi durdurur
O yaramazlaşır, evet
Düşürmek ve aşağı düşürmek
O alçaldığında, alçaldığında
O daha da alçalır, alçalır
Evet, o bilir, evet
Evet, o beni edepsizce dans ettirmeyi biliyor
O alçaldığında, alçaldığında
Evet, o bilir, evet
Evet, o beni edepsizce dans ettirmeyi biliyor
Edepsizce dans etmek
Edepsizce dans etmek
Edepsizce dans etmek
Evet, o şimdi ateşi parlatıyor
Biz yabanileşiyor, bir hayvan gibi
Turşu gibi, terletecek
Kabadayılaştıkça, kabadayılaştıkça
Bakışları üzerine çekmek ve kafaları yukarı kaldırmak
Boyunları kırmak, o bardakları getiriyor
Ona bak, onun için yeterli değil
Kabadayılaştıkça, kabadayılaştıkça
O bedeninin konuşmasına izin verir
O partiyi durdurur
O yaramazlaşır, evet
Düşürmek ve aşağı düşürmek
O alçaldığında, alçaldığında
O daha da alçalır, alçalır
Evet, o bilir, evet
Evet, o beni edepsizce dans ettirmeyi biliyor
O alçaldığında, alçaldığında
Evet, o bilir, evet

Tüm oğlanlar gider, yo-yo-yo
Tüm kızlar gider, yo-yo-yo
Herkes gider, yo-yo-yo
O bizi edepsizce dans ettirdi

O daha da alçalır, alçalır
Evet, o bilir, evet
Evet, o beni edepsizce dans ettirmeyi biliyor
O beni edepsizce dans ettirdi
Edepsizce dans etmek
Evet, o beni edepsizce dans ettirdi
Evet, beni kaptı, kaptı, kaptı, edepsizce dans etmek
O alçaldığında, alçaldığında
O daha da alçalır, alçalır
Evet, o bilir, evet
Evet, o beni edepsizce dаnѕ ettirmeyi biliyor

Ламаючи шиї, вона приносить чашки
Подивись на неї, не може отримати достатньо

They say there's nothing
Nothing here

Nu poți să rămâi
Rămâi cu mine până în noapte
Rămâi, am nevoie de tine aproape
Poți să pleci când soarele răsare din nou
Doar rămâi în seara asta, doar rămâi
Ai văzut spiritul meu
Pierdut în noapte
Noaptea violentă
Mi-au luat lumina
Ei ne numesc nimic
Numele meu e nimic
Vino să mă vezi
Te rog să mă vezi

Toți văd frica mea
Ei spun că nu e nimic
Nimic aici

Am nevoie de lumina mea

Vor risipi întunericul
O numesc libertate
Numele nostru este libertate
Vino să mă găsești
Te rog să mă găsești
Pentru că acum dansez cu zânele
Toate cântă numele noastre

Все правила делают тебя слабее
Но, детка, позволь мне кое-что сказать
Девочка, после каждой слезинки, что выдавил из тебя этот мир
Обними меня, я всегда буду на твоей стороне
Не бойся раскрыть свои крылья и взлететь
Скажи им
Повысь свой голос и говори громко
Покажи им
Что ты бесстрашна и горда
Скажи им
""Это я, спасибо вам, я горжусь""
Иди и скажи им
Повысь свой голос и говори громко
Покажи им
Что ты бесстрашна и горда
Скажи им
""Это я, спасибо вам, я горжусь, горжусь, горжусь""

Скажи им

Як виглядати, посміхатись, поводитись та рухатись
Всі правила зроблені, щоб ти програла
Але крихітко, дозволь мені дещо сказати
Дівчино, за кожну сльозу — світ примушує тебе плакати
Тримайся біля мене, я завжди на твоїй стороні
Не бійся розпустити крила та летіти
Скажи їм
Підвищи голос і скажи це гучно
Покажи їм
Що це означає — стояти, пишаючись
Скажи їм
Це — я, і дякуючи тобі, я собою пишаюсь, пишаюсь, пишаюсь
А тепер скажи їм
Підвищи голос і скажи це гучно
Покажи їм
Що це означає — стояти, пишаючись
Скажи їм
Це — я, і дякуючи тобі, я собою пишаюсь, пишаюсь, пишаюсь
Дівчино, вони намагатимуться сказати тобі, що робити
Не бійся, сила — в тобі
Засвітись, іди і поруш правила
А тепер скажи їм
Підвищи голос і скажи це гучно
Покажи їм
Що це означає — стояти, пишаючись
Скажи їм
Це — я, і дякуючи тобі, я собою пишаюсь, пишаюсь, пишаюсь
А тепер скажи їм
Підвищи голос і скажи це гучно

Що це означає — стояти, пишаючись

Tryna keep them all inside
Hollow shadows and my soul is spilling over
I'm out of time, mmm-mmh
Closing every door, wanna be alone
Lonely is a way that I survive
Sick of wanting more, sitting on the floor
Wondering where all my feelings go
Nervous system's aching

I am cautious
'Cause I've never understood how so much can fit in little me

Sink deeper in the flow of it

Are hiding all my tears

Играя Тетрис с чувствата си
Опитвам се да ги задържа всичките вътре
Празни сенки и душата ми прелива
Нямам време, ммм-мм
Затварям всички врати, искам да бъда сам
Самотата е начинът, по който оцелявам
Досада ми е да искам още, седейки на пода
Чудя се къде отиват всичките ми чувства
Нервната система ме боли
Отрастването става скучно
Не разбирам го
Има океан от емоции, които нося в себе си
Съм внимателен
Защото никога не съм разбирал как толкова много може да се събере в мен
Звезден дух
И съм свикнал да се отпускам
Потъвай по-дълбоко в потока на това
Демоните ми точно знаят къде се крият всичките ми страхове
Съкровените всичките ми сълзи
Раздирам се от болката в нервната система
Отрастването става скучно
Тревожността изтощава
Става скучно да te събуждам
И ако някога си взема тази секунда да оставя притесненията зад гърба си
Може би ще мога да стъпя върху водите на времето
Да изляза извън моя разум
Отрастването означава стареене
Стареенето означава стареене
Да стана означава да остарея
Ако светът ти се разпада
И отрастването става скучно
Знай, че си струва да бъдеш спасен
И да се изправиш е всичко, което имаш

Hey lover, give me some sugar
Just took a little kiss to show how I was missing out
Compared to you no one has anything to brag about
Your lips are hot and sweet, I feel it to my knees
Now I want only one, sugar, sugar on my tongue
I need your kisseѕ baby, gotta keep 'em coming
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Sugаr
Nie potrafię tego wyjaśnić, ale coś jest na rzeczy
Szalona energia we mnie
Najpierw jedynie ciarki, lecz później przerodziło się to w pożar
Niczym ogień w mojej krwii
I teraz słyszę, jak moje ciało mówi, mówi, mówi
Smak to wszystko, wszystko czego potrzebuję
I będę kłębkiem nerwów
Nie ma opcji, że będę sama dzisiaj w nocy
Wpadaj, wpadaj
Mam dosyć bez Ciebie
Wpadaj, wpadaj
Hej, kochanku! Daj mi trochę cukru
Uzależniłam się, więc nie możesz jej zabrać
Usatysfakcjonuj mnie
I teraz słyszę, jak moje ciało mówi, mówi, mówi
Posmakowanie to wszystko, czego potrzebuję
I będę kłębkiem nerwów
Nie ma opcji, że będę sama dzisiaj w nocy
Wpadaj, wpadaj
Mam dosyć bez Ciebie
Wpadaj, wpadaj
Hej, kochanku! Daj mi trochę cukru
Dałam małego buziaka, aby pokazać jak bardzo tęskniłam
W porównaniu do Ciebie, nikt nie ma się czym przechwalać
Twoje usta są gorące i słodkie, czuję to na moich kolanach
Chcę tylko jednego - cukru, cukru na moim języku
Potrzebuję Twoich pocałunków kotku, musisz je cały czas doѕtarczаć
U-u, u-u, u-u
Cukier
Nu pot să explic, dar se întâmplă ceva
O energie nebună înăuntrul meu
Mai întâi doar un furnicăt, apoi s-a transformat într-o arsură
Ca focul în sângele meu
Și acum aud cum corpul meu vorbește, vorbește, vorbește
Un gust este tot ce am nevoie
Și sunt pe cale să urc pe pereți
Nici o șansă să fiu singură în seara asta
Vino, vino
Mi-am cam luat-o fără tine
Vino, vino
Hei iubire, dă-mi puțin zahăr
M-ai făcut dependent, așa că nu poți să mi-l iei
Fă-mă să mă simt complet mulțumită
Și acum aud cum corpul meu vorbește, vorbește, vorbește
Un gust este tot ce am nevoie
Și sunt pe cale să urc pe pereți
Nici o șansă să fiu singură în seara asta
Vino, vino
Mi-am cam luat-o fără tine
Vino, vino
Hei iubire, dă-mi puțin zahăr
Am luat doar un sărut mic să-ți arăt cum simțeam că-mi lipsește
Comparat cu tine, nimeni nu are ce să se laude
Buzele tale sunt fierbinți și dulci, simt asta până la genunchi
Acum vreau doar unul, zahăr, zahăr pe limba mea
Am nevoie de săruturile tale, dragule, trebuie ѕă le continui

I can't make her stay
When I know that she's so far above
How could she ever love someone like me?
She's out of reach
Here in the dark
Inside a hole in my heart
I'm fighting all of my demons tryna tear me apart
And I'm still not sure what you ever saw in me
No, I'm a, I'm a fallen angel
And no matter where my heart is
There's no way I'll ever reach up to heaven to you
She's so far out of this world
No way I could ever be with her
'Cause I know heaven's your home
That's where angels belong
And it wouldn't be fair

Hva kan jeg si, for å få hun til å bli
Når jeg vet jeg er så langt ifra
Så perfekt som hun var
Å det føltes så stort
Kanskje jeg drømte meg bort
For jeg er så svak
Jeg tenker fortsatt på alt
Jeg egentlig ville si til deg men aldri får sagt
Og hvem kan forstå hva du noen gang så i meg
Nei, hun er alt for bra for meg
Men hun får alle mine tusen tårer å tørke
Gjør lys ut av mørket for meg
Hun åpnet himmelen for meg
Jeg står som en flamme ute i regn
Jeg er evig din, gi meg mere tid
Men alle engeler må fly
Og jeg finner ingen ny
For jeg er så svak
Jeg tenker fortsatt på alt
Jeg egentlig ville si til deg men aldri får sagt
Og hvem kan forstå hva du noen gang så i meg
Nei, hun er alt for bra for meg

Ce pot să spun?
Nu pot să o fac să rămână
Când știu că ea este atât de mult deasupra mea
Cum ar putea vreodată să iubească pe cineva ca mine?
Ea este în afara a ceea ce pot atinge
Aici în întuneric
Într-un gol din inima mea
Lupt cu toți demonii mei care încearcă să mă sfâșie
Și tot nu sunt sigur ce ai văzut vreodată în mine
Nu, sunt un, sunt un înger căzut
Și indiferent unde este inima mea
Nu există nicio șansă să ajung vreodată în cer la tine
Ea este atât de departe din lumea aceasta
Nu există nicio șansă să pot fi vreodată cu ea
Pentru că știu că cerul este casa ta
Acolo își au locul îngerii
Și nu ar fi corect
Dacă te-aș ține jos aici
Aici în întuneric
Într-un gol din inima mea
Lupt cu toți demonii mei care încearcă să mă sfâșie
Și tot nu sunt sigur ce ai văzut vreodată în mine
Nu, sunt un, sunt un înger căzut

Că e în regulă să mă lași să plec
Pentru că indiferent unde este inima mea
Nu există nicio șansă să ajung vreodată în cer la tine

Da, sunt un, sunt un înger căzut
Și încă nu sunt sigur ce ai văzut vreodată în mine

Что я могу сказать?
Я не могу заставить ее остаться
Когда я знаю, что она так далеко от меня
Как она могла полюбить такого, как я?
Она вне досягаемости
Здесь, в темноте
В моем сердце пустота
Я борюсь со всеми своими демонами, которые пытаются разорвать меня на части
И я до сих пор не уверен, что ты вообще во мне что-то нашла
Нет, я, я падший ангел
И не важно, где мое сердце
И я, конечно, никогда не попаду в рай к тебе
Она так далека от этого мира
Я ни за что не смогу быть с ней рядом
Потому что я знаю, что твой дом - небеса
Там место ангелам
И было бы несправедливо
Если бы я держал тебя здесь, внизу
Здесь, в темноте
Внутри пустоты в моем сердце
Я борюсь со всеми своими демонами, которые пытаются разорвать меня на части
И я до сих пор не уверен, что ты вообще во мне что-то нашла
Нет, я падший ангел
Пытаюсь летать, но у меня не получается, о-о-о-о
И мне нужно, чтобы ты знала
Что ты можешь отпустить меня, это нормально
Потому что, где бы ни было мое сердце
Я, конечно, никогда не попаду в рай к тебе
Я, я падший ангел
Да, я, я падший ангел
И я до сих пор не уверен, что ты вообще во мне что-то нашла
Нет, я падший ангел
Пытаюсь взлететь, но у меня не получается
Так что просто отпусти меня
Ведь не важно, где мое сердце
Я, конечно, никогда не попаду в рай к тебе

No puedo hacer que se quede

Que yo te mantuviera aquí

Lucho contra los demonios que tratan de romperme

That what we had was really unbelievable
Unbeatable, a miracle
Why'd you have to go and mess it up
Why'd you have to make what was unbreakable
Shakeable, unsaveable
Now it is too late to cross your fingers
I am wide awake and not a dreamer
Hate it but it seems the dreams were never true
For a little while the fates were with us
Wonder why they had to turn against us
I could make a wish but there is no use
I can feel
Even though i'm numb
The change to come
Will hurt someone
I can see
This time it isn't me
I might be
The lucky one
I don't need a crystal ball to show me
Baby it is plain that you don't know me
When it comes to you I'm better off alone
I don't need a crystal ball to make me
Realize that if I stay you'll break me
Every sign is saying I should be gone
I should be gone
Thought I had a cloud over my head
It had to be my fault that it kept raining down
Until now I figured out
That if I had the nerve to say goodbye
I could look for clearer skies up over head
Weather says
Sun instead

Te întrebi dacă ți-a trecut vreodată prin minte
Că ceea ce aveam era cu adevărat incredibil
Imbatabil, o minune
De ce a trebuit să strici totul
De ce a trebuit să faci ceea ce era indestructibil
Să devină instabil, nesalvabil
Acum este prea târziu să-ți încrucișezi degetele
Sunt complet treaz și nu un visător
Îmi displace, dar se pare că visele nu au fost niciodată reale
Pentru o vreme, soarta a fost de partea noastră
Mă întreb de ce a trebuit să se întoarcă împotriva noastră

Va răni pe cineva

De coșmarurile, cu care m-am luptat
Ușor de fugit, mai greu de rămas

Well this is not what I wanted
Guess all the good things come to an end
So baby bye bye
Wish you the best
But most of all I wish that I could love you less
Well maybe you're right
I'll find someone else
You say it isn't me but when did that ever help
Hold me closer
Although you'll leave before the sunrise
Might be bleeding, but don't you mind, I'll be fine
Oh it kills me
I found the right one at the wrong time
But until the sunrise
Hold tight
Hold tight
Maybe it happened too fast
I guess that I understand
You say that you've never felt this way for anyone
And that's why it scares you to death
So baby bye bye
Know it's for the best
Still I can't see how that would ease the pain in my chest

No tämä ei ole mitä halusin
Vissiin kaikki hyvä loppuu

Toivon sinulle parasta
Mutta toivoin kaikkein eniten että voisin rakastaa sinua vähemmän
No kai sinä ole oikeassa
Löydän jonkun toisen
Sanot etten se ole minä mutta milloin tuo ikinä auttoi
Pidä minua lähempänä
Vaikka et ikinä lähde ennen auringonnousua
Taidan vuotaa verta, mutta älä välitä, olen kunnossa
Oh se tappaa minut

Pidä tiukasti kiinni
Ehkä se tapahtui liian nopeasti
Luulen että ymmärrän
Sanot, että et ole koskaan tuntenut näin ketään kohtaan
Ja siksi se pelottaa sinut kuolemaan

Tiedän, se on parhaaksi
En silti ymmärrä, kuinka se helpottaisi rintakipua

Sattuu todella pahasti

כי אין על מה להתחרט

אך יותר מהכול אני מקווה שאוכל לאהוב אותך פחות

אמצא מישהו אחר

מצאתי את האדם הנכון בזמן הלא נכון
אבל עד הזריחה
אתה יכול פשוט להחזיק אותי חזק?
אני יודעת שאני חייבת לשחרר, אבל רק תן לי את הלילה
כי מחר יכאב
יכאב ממש
כי אני עומדת לאבד את הטוב ביותר שהיה לי אי פעם
החזק אותי קרוב יותר
על אף שתעזוב לפני הזריחה
יכול להיות שאדמם, אבל אל תדאג, אהיה בסדר

Больше не нужно извинений
Потому что прощать нечего
Что ж, это не то, чего я хотела
Но все хорошее, когда-либо кончается
Поэтому, детка, прощай
Всего наилучшего
Но я хочу тебя любить меньше всего
Думаю, ты прав
Я найду кого-нибудь другого
Говоришь, что это не я, но это не помогало
Обними меня крепче
Перед тем, как я уйду перед рассветом
Может я истекаю кровью, но не обращай на это внимания
Это убивает меня
Я нашла что-то хорошее в плохое время
Но до рассвета
Обними крепче
Обними меня…
Может все произошло слишком быстро
Я понимаю это
Ты говоришь, что никогда не испытывал таких эмоций
И поэтому тебя это до жути пугает
Поэтому, детка, прощай
Знай, все это к лучшему
Но не знаю, как это облегчит мою боль
Обними меня крепче
Перед тем, как я уйду перед рассветом
Может я истекаю кровью, но не обращай на это внимания
Это убивает меня
Я нашла что-то хорошее в плохое время
Но до рассвета
Можешь меня обнять посильнее
Я должна уйти, но прошу, подари мне последнюю ночь
Потому что завтра принесет боль
Еще более сильную
Потому что самое лучшее, что у меня было, я вот-вот потеряю
Обними меня крепче
Перед тем, как я уйду перед рассветом
Может я истекаю кровью, но не обращай на это внимания
Это убивает меня
Я нашла что-то хорошее в плохое время
Но до рассвета
Можешь меня обнять посильнее
Я должна уйти, но прошу, подари мне последнюю ночь
Разве ты не видишь, что ты нашел что-то хорошее в плохое время
Это просто не то время
Обними крепче
Обними
No te tienes que disculpar
Porque no hay nada que lamentar
Bueno, esto no es lo que quería
Supongo que todas las cosas buenas llegan a su fin
Así que cariño, adiós
Te deseo lo mejor
Pero sobre todo desearía poder amarte menos
Bueno, tal vez tengas razón
Encontraré a alguien más
Dices que no soy yo, pero ¿cuándo ayudó eso?
Abrázame más fuerte
Aunque te marches antes del amanecer
Puede que sangre, pero no te preocupes, estaré bien
Ay me mata
Encontré al correcto en el momento equivocado
Pero hasta el amanecer
Abrázame fuerte
Abrázame fuerte
Tal vez sucedió demasiado rápido
Supongo que entiendo
Dices que nunca te has sentido así por nadie
Y por eso te da un susto de muerte
Así que cariño, adiós
Se que es lo mejor
Todavía no puedo ver cómo eso aliviaría el dolor en mi pecho
Abrázame más fuerte
Aunque te marcharas antes del amanecer
Puede que sangre, pero no te preocupes, estaré bien
Ay me mata
Encontré al correcto en el momento equivocado
Pero hasta el amanecer
¿Podrías abrazarme fuerte?
Sé que tendré que soltarte, pero solo dame la noche
Porque mañana dolerá
Dolerá mucho
Porque estoy a punto de perder lo mejor que he tenido
Abrázame más fuerte
Aunque te marcharas antes del amanecer
Puede que sangre, pero no te preocupes, estaré bien
Ay me mata
Encontré al correcto en el momento equivocado
Pero hasta el amanecer
¿Podrías abrazarme fuerte?
Sé que tendré que soltarte, pero solo dame la noche
¿No ves que encontraѕte el correcto en el momento equivocado?
Era el momento equivocado
Abrázame fuerte
Abrázаme fuerte

Antar att jag förstår
Du säger att du aldrig känt så här för någon
Och därför är du skrämd till döds
Så älskling hej då
Vet att det är för det bästa
Kan fortfarande inte förstå hur det skulle lindra min smärta över huvud taget
Håll mig närmare
Trots att du lämnar innan soluppgången
Jag kanske blöder men bry dig inte, jag blir okej
Åh, det dödar mig
Jag fann den rätta men vid fel tid
Men tills soluppgången
Kan du bara hålla om mig hårt
Jag vet att jag måste gå men ge mig bara natten
För imorgon kommer göra ont
Väldigt hemskt ont
För jag kommer förlora det bästa jag någonsin haft
Håll mig närmare
Trots att du lämnar innan soluppgången
Jag kanske blöder men bry dig inte, jag blir okej
Åh, det dödar mig
Jag fann den rätta men vid fel tid
Men tills soluppgången
Kan du bara hålla om mig hårt
Jag vet att jag måste gå men ge mig bara natten
Kan du inte förѕtå att du fann den rätta vid fel tid
Det var barа fel tid

What is the secret behind Meghan Markle's healthy hair?
What could be the secret?
I think that secret is the deep hydration
As they say
One's skin and hair reveal everything clearly
For example: dark circles around eyes point out to liver issues
Dark spots around lips might mean you have an enlarged spleen
An enlarged spleen is not good, not pretty
Because an artist - she has to be healthy
She has to be healthy, be healthy
Be healthy, be be be be healthy
Be healthy, be healthy
Be healthy, she has to, has to, has to
It's such fortune that
The autonomic nervous system exists
So I don't have to control my heartbeats
Because the heart beats, it beats on its own
Nice days, bright colors of the skirt on my body
Of my skirt, my dog and I
We are taking a walk, counting our steps
The skirt goes around my leg
We are taking a walk and that's it
And it doesn't have to be better than that, the heart beats on its own
I put my trust in it, that it beats on its own
I put my trust in it, that it beats, that I breathe
God give me health, God give health, God give health
God give health
I don't have the health insurance
Oh, so how will they monitor me? In the name of health
And care about me? In the name of health
An artist is invisible. In the name of health
You don't see me, it's magic. In the name of health
An artist, she can be healthy
She can be healthy, be healthy
Be healthy, be be be be healthy
Be healthy, be healthy
Be healthy, she has to, has to, has to

In a healthy body, in a healthy body

On a bike of diamonds
You told me, you've changed
I no longer see the light in your eyes
What is your fear?
A sea where you never touch
Even if sex is not
The way out from the bottom
Come on, don't run away from here
Don't leave me like this
Naked with shivers
Sometimes I don't know how to express myself
And I want to love you, but I'm always wrong
And I want to steal you a sky of pearls
And I would pay to go away
I would even accept a lie
And I want to love you, but I'm always wrong
And I get shivers, shivers, shivers
You, who wake me up in the morning
You, who dirty the bed with wine
You, who bite my skin
With your viper eyes
And you, you are the opposite of an angel
And you, you are like a boxer in the corner
And you run away from here, leaving me like this
Naked with shivers
Sometimes I don't know how to express myself
And I want to love you, but I'm always wrong
And I want to steal you a sky of pearls
And I would pay to go away

And I want to love you, but I'm always wrong
And I get shivers, shivers, shivers
Tell me I'm not right
I live inside a prison
I try to stay close to you
And I'm sorry if I fuck it all up
I can't tell you what I feel, it's my limitation
For an ""I love you"" I mixed drugs and tears
This poison that we spit every day
I don't want it on me anymore
You see, I'm here
On a bike of diamonds, one among many
Naked with shivers
Sometimes I don't know how to express myself
And I want to love you, but I'm always wrong

As the other kids playing the same game
Tried to jump on in, but they push away
So far away
I'm not the same, no
I'm not the same, no
Years go by, I tried and tried
My father asked me if today I smiled
I said, ""Yes I did"", but that's a lie
Oh, I always tell those lies
And you run and hide, hide the break inside
Do you realise that the light shines bright?
Through those, oh, who broke inside
I'm not the same, no
I'm not the same, no
I'm not the same, no
I'm not the same, no
'Cause you never want to be a kind of person
You can work it for those ones who cannot word it
Because you've been the kind of person who felt this pain
Yeah, I felt this pain
So you're gonna leave the pain and find another way to make yourself another game
Maybe one for all to play
'Cause it's not just me who's not the same
We are not the same
I'm not the same, no
We are not the same, no
We are not the same, no
We are not the ѕаme, no
On m'a dit à six ans
Qu'ils m'éviteraient si mon cœur était froid
Trouvant compliqué de parler et dire mes pensées
Ils n'aimeront jamais les choses que j'aime
Car on te dit de jouer, mais tu n'es pas le même
Que les autres enfants jouant au même jeu
J'ai essayé de les rejoindre, mais ils m'ont repoussé
Si loin
Je ne suis pas le même, non
Je ne suis pas le même, non
Les années sont passées, j'ai essayé et essayé
Mon père m'a demandé si aujourd'hui j'avais souris
J'ai dit, ""Oui, je l'ai fait"", mais c'est un mensonge
Oh, je dis toujours ces mensonges
Et tu cours et te caches, cache la cassure intérieur
Réalises-tu que la lumière brille ?
À travers ceux, oh, qui sont cassé de l'intérieur
Je ne suis pas le même, non
Je ne suis pas le même, non
Je ne suis pas le même, non
Je ne suis pas le même, non
Car tu ne veux pas être le genre de personne
Tu peux le faire pour ceux qui ne peuvent l'exprimer
Parce que tu as été le genre de personne à ressentir cette peine
Oui, je sens cette peine
Donc tu vas laisser cette peine et trouvé un autre moyen de faire un autre jeu
Peut-être un pour que tout le monde joue
Car ce n'est pas juste moi qui n'est pas le même
Nous ne sommes pas le même
Je ne suis pas le même
Nous ne sommes pas le même
Nous ne sommes pas le même
Nous ne sommes pаѕ le même
Als ich sechs Jahre alt war sagte man mir
Sie würden mich meiden, wenn mein Herz kalt ist
Mir fiel es schwer zu reden und meine Gedanken auszudrücken
Sie mochten nie die Sachen, die ich mögen würde
Denn du wirst zum spielen aufgefordert, aber bist nicht derselbe
Wie die anderen Kinder, die das gleiche Spiel spielen
Versuchtest einzuspringen, aber sie stoßen dich weg
So weit weg
Ich bin nicht derselbe, nein
Ich bin nicht derselbe, nein
Die Jahre vergehen, ich versuchte es immer wieder
Mein Vater fragte mich, ob ich ich heute gelächelt hatte
Ich sagte ""Ja, habe ich"", doch das ist eine Lüge
Oh, immer erzähle ich solche Lügen
Und du rennst und versteckst dich, versteckst den innerlichen Riss
Bemerkst du, dass das Licht hell scheint?
Durch die, oh, die innerlich gebrochen sind
Ich bin nicht derselbe, nein
Ich bin nicht derselbe, nein
Ich bin nicht derselbe, nein
Ich bin nicht derselbe, nein
Denn du willst niemals die Art von Mensch sein
Du kannst denjenigen helfen, die es nicht in Worte fassen können, weil du die Art von Mensch gewesen bist, die diesen Schmerz spürte
Ja, ich spürte diesen Schmerz
Also lässt du den Schmerz hinter dir und findest einen anderen Weg
Um dir ein anderes Spiel zu machen
Vielleicht eines für аlle zum Spielen
Weil ich nicht der einzige bin, der nicht derselbe ist
Wir sind nicht dieselben
Wir sind nicht dieselben, nein
Wir sind nicht dieselben, nein
Wir sind nicht dieselben, nein
Wir sind nicht dieѕelben, nein
אמרו לי בגיל שש
שהם היו מתרחקים ממני אם הלב שלי היה קר
קשה לי היה לדבר ולהביע את דעתי
הם לעולם לא יאהבו את הדברים שאני אהבתי
כי אומרים לך לשחק, אבל אתה לא כמו השאר
לא כמו הילדים האחרים שמשחקים את אותו המשחק
ניסיתי לקפוץ פנימה, אבל הם דחפו אותי
כל כך רחוק
אני לא אותו הדבר, לא
אני לא אותו הדבר, לא
שנים חולפות, ניסיתי וניסיתי
אבי שאל אותי אם היום חייכתי
אמרתי, ""כן חייכתי"", אבל זה היה שקר
אוה, אני תמיד מספרת את השקרים האלה
ואתה רץ ומסתתר, מסתיר את השבר בפנים
האם אתה מבין שהאור זורח בבהירות?
דרך אלה, אה, שנשברו בפנים
אני לא אותו הדבר, לא
אני לא אותו הדבר, לא
אני לא אותו הדבר, לא
אני לא אותו הדבר, לא
כי אתה לעולם לא רוצה להיות אותו סוג של אדם
אתה יכול לעבוד בשביל אלה שלא יודעים לבטא את זה
כי אתה היית מסוג האנשים שחוו את הכאב הזה
כן, חוויתי את הכאב הזה
אז אתה תעזוב את הכאב ותמצא דרך אחרת ליצור לעצמך משחק חדש
אולי משחק אחד שכולם יוכלו לשחק
כי זה לא רק אני שלא אותו הדבר
אנחנו לא אותו הדבר
אני לא אותו הדבר, לא
אנחנו לא אותו הדבר, לא
אנחנו לא אותו הדבר, לא
אנחנו לא אותו הדבר, לא
Mi è stato detto a sei anni
Mi avrebbero evitato se il mio cuore fosse stato freddo
Ho trovato difficile parlare e dire la mia mente
A loro non piacerebbero mai le cose che vorrei io
Perché ti viene detto di giocare, ma non sei lo stesso
Come gli altri bambini che giocano allo stesso gioco
Ho provato a saltare dentro, ma si allontanano
Così lontano
Non sono lo stesso, no
Non sono lo stesso, no
Gli anni passano, ho provato e provato
Mio padre mi ha chiesto se oggi ho sorriso
Ho detto: ""Sì, l'ho fatto"", ma questa è una bugia
Oh, dico sempre quelle bugie
E tu corri e ti nascondi, nascondi la pausa dentro
Ti rendi conto che la luce brilla luminosa?
Attraverso quelli, oh, che hanno rotto dentro
Non sono lo stesso, no
Non sono lo stesso, no
Non sono lo stesso, no
Non sono lo stesso, no
Perché non vuoi mai essere un tipo di persona
Puoi lavorarlo per quelli che non possono dirlo
Perché sei stato il tipo di persona che ha sentito questo dolore
Sì, ho sentito questo dolore
Quindi lascerai il dolore e troverai un altro modo per farti un altro gioco
Forse uno per tutti da giocare
Perché non sono solo io che non sono lo stesso
Non siamo uguali
Non sono lo stesso, no
Non siamo gli stessi, no
Non siamo gli stessi, no
Non siаmo gli stesѕi, no
난 여섯 살 때 들었다
내 마음이 차가우면 그들은 나를 피할 거라고
마음을 표현하는 게 어렵다는 걸 알았어
그들은 내가 좋아하는 것을 절대 좋아하지 않을 거야
왜냐하면 넌 놀라고 말하지만 넌 다르니까
다른 아이들과 같은 게임을 하려고 해
들어가려고 하지만 그들은 널 밀쳐내
너무 멀리
난 같지 않아, 다른 거야
난 같지 않아, 다른 거야
몇 년이 지나, 난 계속 시도했어
아버지는 오늘 내가 웃었는지 물어봤어
난 ""네, 웃었어요""라고 말했지만 거짓말이었지
오, 난 항상 그런 거짓말을 해
그리고 넌 도망쳐 숨어, 속의 상처를 숨기고
빛이 밝게 빛나는 걸 알고 있니?
그것들을 통해서, 오, 누가 속상한지
난 같지 않아, 다른 거야
난 같지 않아, 다른 거야
난 같지 않아, 다른 거야
난 같지 않아, 다른 거야
왜냐하면 넌 그런 사람이 되고 싶지 않으니까
말 못 하는 사람들을 위해 일할 수 있어
왜냐하면 넌 그런 아픔을 겪은 사람이었으니까
그래, 난 그 아픔을 느꼈어
그래서 넌 아픔을 떠나 다른 게임을 만들 방법을 찾을 거야
모두가 즐길 수 있는 게임
왜냐하면 나만 다른 게 아니니까
우린 다 같지 않아
난 같지 않아, 다른 거야
우린 다 같지 않아, 다른 거야
우린 다 같지 않아, 다른 거야
우린 다 같지 않아, 다른 거야
Pri šestih letih so mi rekli
Izogibali bi se me, če bi moje srce bilo hladno
Težko sem govoril in povedal svoje mnenje
Nikoli jim ne bi bile všeč stvari, ki bi bile všeč meni
Ker ti je rečeno, da se igraj, a nisi isti
Kot drugi otroci, ki igrajo isto igro
Poskušal sem skočiti noter, a so me odrinili stran
Tako daleč stran
Nisem isti, ne
Nisem isti, ne
Leta so minevala, poskušal sem in poskušal
Oče me je vprašal, če sem se danes nasmehnil
Rekel sem: ""Ja, sem"", ampak to je laž
Oh, vedno govorim te laži
In bežiš in se skrivaš, skrivaš zlom v sebi
Se zavedaš, da luč močno sveti?
Za nas, oh, ki so vdrli v nas
Nisem isti, ne
Nisem isti, ne
Nisem isti, ne
Nisem isti, ne
Ker nikoli nisem želel biti ta oseba
To lahko storite za tiste, ki tega ne znajo ubesediti
Ker si bil človek, ki je čutil to bolečino
Ja, čutil sem to bolečino
Torej boš pustil bolečino in našel drug način, da si narediš novo igro
Morda enega za vse
Ker nisem samo jaz enaka
Nismo enaki
Nisem isti, ne
Nismo enaki, ne
Nismo enaki, ne
Niѕmo enаki, ne
Me dijeron a los seis años
Que me evitarían si mi corazón estuviera frío
Les resultaba difícil hablar y decir lo que pensaba
Nunca les gustarían las cosas que a mí me gustarían
Porque te dicen que juegues, pero no eres el mismo
Que los otros niños que juegan el mismo juego
Intentó saltar, pero se alejaron
Tan lejos
No soy el mismo, no
No soy el mismo, no
Pasan los años, lo intenté y lo intenté
Mi padre me preguntó si hoy sonreía
Le dije: ""Sí, lo hice"", pero eso es mentira
Oh, siempre digo esas mentiras
Y corres y te escondes, escondes la ruptura por dentro
¿Te das cuenta de que la luz brilla intensamente?
A través de aquellos, oh, que se rompieron por dentro
No soy el mismo, no
No soy el mismo, no
No soy el mismo, no
No soy el mismo, no
Porque nunca quieres ser un tipo de persona
Puedes trabajarlo para aquellos que no pueden expresarlo
Porque has sido el tipo de persona que sintió este dolor
Sí, sentí este dolor
Así que dejarás el dolor y encontrarás otra forma de convertirte en otro juego
Tal vez uno para todos
Porque no soy solo yo quien no es igual
No somos iguаles
No soy el mismo, no
No somos lo mismo, no
No somos lo mismo, no
No somos lo miѕmo, no
Bana 6 yaşımda
Kalbim soğuk olursa benden kaçacakları söylendi
Konuşmayı ve fikrimi söylemeyi zor buldum
Sevdiğim şeyleri onlar asla sevmedi
Çünkü sana oynaman söylendi, ama sen aynı değilsin
Aynı oyunu oynayan diğer çocuklar gibi
İçeri atlamaya çalıştılar ama ittiler
Çok uzak
Ben aynı değilim, hayır
Ben aynı değilim, hayır
Yıllar geçiyor, denedim ve denedim
Babam bugün gülümseyip gülümsemediğimi sordu
""Evet gülümsedim"" dedim ama bu bir yalan
Ah, o yalanları hep söylerim
Ve koş ve saklan, içindeki kırılmayı sakla
Işığın parladığının farkında mısın?
Onların üzerinden, ah, içini kıran
Ben aynı değilim, hayır
Ben aynı değilim, hayır
Ben aynı değilim, hayır
Ben aynı değilim, hayır
Çünkü asla bu tarz bir kişi olmak istemezsin
Söyleyemeyenler için çalışabilirsin
Çünkü sen bu acıyı hisseden türden bir insandın
Evet, bu acıyı hissettim
O zaman acıyı bırakacaksın ve kendine başka bir oyun yapmak için başka bir yol bulacaksın
Belki herkesin oynamaѕı için bir tane

Kuin olisi ollut niin helppoa päästää sinusta irti
Tarvitsen vain aikaa
Napsauttaen yksi, kaksi
Missä olet?
Olet silti sydämessäni
Napsauttaen kolme, neljä
En tarvitse sinua täällä enää
Lähde pois sydämestäni
Koska taidan napsauttaa
Kirjoitan laulua
Sanottiin, ""tämä on se viimeinen""
Kuinka monta viimeistä laulua on jäljellä?
En pysy mukana laskuissa
Kesäkuun 22. päivästä lähtien
Sydämeni on ollut tulessa
Vietin yöni kehässä
Yritin laittaa sen pois
Joten napsautan yksi, kaksi
Missä olet
Olet silti sydämessäni
Napsauttaen kolme, neljä
En tarvitse sinua täällä enää
Lähde pois sydämestäni
Koska taidan napsauttaa
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Koska taidan napsauttaa
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Ja jos yksikin ihminen sanoo, ""sinun pitäisi päästä siitä yli""
Oh, taidan lopettaa ihmisten kanssa puhumisen ennen kuin napsautan, napsautan, napsautan
Oh, taidan lopettaa ihmisten kanssa puhumisen ennen kuin napsautan
Napsauttaen yksi, kaksi
Missä olet? (Missä olet?)
Olet silti sydämessäni (Silti sydämessäni)
Napsauttaen kolme, neljä
En tarvitse sinua täällä enää (Tarvitse sinua täällä enää)
Lähde pois sydämestäni
Koska taidan napsauttaa
Oh-oh-oh-ooh (Napsauta)
Koska taidan napsauttaa
Oh-oh-oh-ooh (Napsauta)
Lähde pois sydämestäni
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Koska taidan napsauttaa
Oh-oh-oh-ooh (Lähde pois sydämestäni, lähde pois minun)
Koska taidan napѕauttaа
Il est 4h du matin
Je ne peux pas éteindre ma tête
Souhaitant que ces souvenirs fondent
Ils ne le font jamais
Apparemment les gens mentent
Ils disent, ""Claque juste tes doigts""
Comme si c'était vraiment facile pour moi de te surmonter
J'ai juste besoin de temps
Claquant des doigts un, deux
Où es-tu ?
Tu es toujours dans mon cœur
Claquant des doigts trois, quatre
Plus besoin de toi ici
Sors de mon coeur
Parce que je pourrais claquer des doigts
J'écris une chanson
Disais, ""C'est la dernière""
Combien de dernières chansons il reste ?
Je perds le compte
Depuis le 22 juin
Mon coeur est en feu
Je passais mes nuits sous la pluie
Essayant de l'éteindre
Donc je claque des doigts un, deux
Où es-tu ?
Tu es toujours dans mon cœur
Claquant des doigts trois, quatre
Plus besoin de toi ici
Sors de mon coeur
Parce que je pourrais claquer des doigts
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Parce que je pourrais claquer des doigts
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Et si quelqu'un de plus dit ""Tu devrais surmonter ça""
Oh, j'arrêterai de parler au gens avant que je claques, claques, claques
Oh, j'arrêterai de parler au gens avant que je claques des doigts
Claquant des doigts un, deux
Où es-tu ? (Où es-tu ?)
Tu es toujours dans mon cœur (Toujours dans mon coeur)
Claquant des doigts trois, quatre
Plus besoin de toi ici (Plus besoin de toi ici)
Sors de mon coeur
Parce que je pourrais claquer des doigts
Oh-oh-oh-ooh (Snap)
Parce que je pourrais claquer des doigts
Oh-oh-oh-ooh (Snap)
Sors de mon coeur
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Parce que je pourrais claquer des doigts
Oh-oh-oh-ooh (Sors de mon coeur, sors de mon)

Sono le 4 del mattino
Non riesco a spegnere la mia testa
Augurandomi che questi ricordi svanissero
Non succede mai
Si scopre che le persone mentono
Loro dicono: ""schiocca appena le tue dita""
Come se fosse davvero così facile per me andare oltre te
Ho solo bisogno di tempo
Schiocco uno, due
Dove sei?
Sei ancora nel mio cuore
Schiocco tre, quattro
Non ho più bisogno di te qui
Esci dal mio cuore
Perchè potrei schioccare
Sto scrivendo una canzone
Dissi ""questa è l'ultima""
Quante ultime canzoni sono rimaste?
Sto perdendo il conto
Dal 22 di giugno
Il mio cuore è stato infuocato
Stavo spendendo le mie notti nell'anello
Provando a toglierlo via
Così schiocco uno, due
Dove sei?
Sei ancora nel mio cuore
Schiocco tre, quattro
Non ho più bisogno di te qui
Esci dal mio cuore
Perchè potrei schioccare
Oh-oh-oh-ohh
Perchè potrei schioccare
Oh-oh-oh-ohh
E se un'altra persona dicesse: ""Dovresti superarlo""
Oh, dovrei smettere di parlare alle persone prima che io schiocchi, schiocchi, schiocchi
Oh, dovrei smettere di parlare alle persone prima che io schiocchi
Schiocco uno, due
Dove sei? (Dove sei?)
Sei ancora nel mio cuore (ancora nel mio cuore)
Schiocco tre, quattro
Non ho più bisogno di te qui (non ho più bisogno di te)
Esci dal mio cuore
Perchè potrei schioccare
Oh-oh-oh-ooh (Schiocco)
Perchè potrei schioccare
Oh-oh-oh-ooh (Schiocco)
Esci dal mio cuore
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Perchè potrei schioccare
Oh-oh-oh-ooh (Esci fuori dal mio cuore, esci fuori dal mio)
Perchè potrei ѕchioccаre
4 утра
Я не могу перестать думать
Хочу чтобы все эти воспоминания растворились
Но они не смогут
Люди лгут мне
Говорят ""Просто сделай щелчок""
Будто мне действительно легко забыть тебя
Мне просто нужно время
Щелкаю раз-два
Но где же ты?
Ты все еще в моей голове
Щелкую три-четыре
Ты мне больше не нужен
Уйди из моего сердца
Я сделала этот щелчок
Я написала песню
""В этот раз точно последняя""
Но сколько еще таких ""последних"" я напишу?
Я сбилась со счета
С 22 июня
Мое сердце в огне
Ночи напролет
Я пыталась отпустить
Щелкаю раз-два
Но где же ты?
Ты все еще в моей голове
Щелкую три-четыре
Ты мне больше не нужен
Уйди из моего сердца
Я сделала этот щелчок
О-о-о-о
Я сделала щелчок
О-о-о-о
Кто-то опять сказал ""Тебе нужно сделать это""
Ох, люди не перестанут мне говорить щелкать вновь и вновь
Ох, люди не перестанут мне говорить щелкать
Щелкаю раз-два
Но где же ты? (Где ты?)
Ты все еще в моей голове (Все еще там)
Щелкую три-четыре
Ты мне больше не нужен (Не нужен больше)
Уйди из моего сердца
Я сделала этот щелчок
О-о-о-о (Щелк)
Я сделала щелчок

We used to be the rockstars
Who never thought of no harm
'Til this thing we call life stopped gleaming
I wish there was a way to go back dreaming
Remembering gets so hard
When time is moving so fast
Wish there was a way to know that we're in
The good old days before we all just leave 'em

I tried getting rid of the pain
I tried to make it go away but it probably won't change
Always thinking 'bout my own worries
Remember back when we had no worries?
Now life just ain't hitting the same
I sit and miss and reminisce about innocent old days
When I was afraid of nobody
Now I'm afraid of being a nobody

Don't wanna leave my bed
I'll just stay and never get it together
'Cause the voices in my head
They keep saying it'll never get better

Look where we are
We used to be the rockstars
Who never thought of no harm

It's only purpose is convincing me that I'm a mess
And even though it's always been an uninvited guest
It finds a way in nonetheless
Wish I could change my address
And you know
Just be somebody else for a couple of days
Although I'm pretty sure we all feel the same kinda way
'Cause if you think about it
Aren't we all set in a place
Where we look back at better days
And wish they weren't so far away?

I wish that I could just go back and be the way I was
I wish I'd still not give a damn 'bout how I come across
I wish the way I saw myself had never gotten lost
In all the worries
All the thoughts
Overthinking
All the parts
So exhausted
Always caught
Up inside my doubts and flaws
And Imma count them all
Somebody catch me, I'm 'bout to fall
Yeah I'm 'bout to fall
Can we press pause?
Or do a restart
And be who we are?

Woke up, you weren't there
Five nights in a row
Of dreams I've never shared

Early in the morning
Timing's never been our thing
Leaving me with guilt

I'm with him and you're a secret treasure
He's devotion, you're a guilty pleasure
I'm with him and this is real life, honey

I'm with him until the death do us part

Would you run away?
Would you run away with me?
Would you run away?
Would you run away?

Sanjala sam te prošlu noć
Probudila sam se, nisi bio ondje
Pet noći zaredom
Snova koje nikad nisam podijelila
Došao si bez upozorenja
Rano ujutro
Tajming nikad nije bila naša stvar
Ostavljaš me s krivnjom
Jedinim suvenirom koji donosiš
Ja sam s njim, a ti si skriveno blago
On je predanost, ti si tajni užitak
Ja sam s njim i ovo je pravi život, dušo
Izgleda da šala više nije smiješna
Ja sam s njim dok nas smrt ne rastavi
Ali to nije utjeha ovom gladnom srcu
Ja sam s njim, ali u mojoj mahnitoj glavi
Uvijek dolaziš ti i kažeš
Bi li pobjegla?
Bi li pobjegla sa mnom?
Bi li pobjegla?
Bi li pobjegla?
Jedna je ljubav dovoljna
To je sve što ćeš ikada dobiti
Barem je to ono što ti kažu
Ipak, ja ne mogu zaboraviti
Oči poput plamtećeg ognja
Do izlaska sunca
Ne mogu se sjetiti što su me naučili
Očarana olujom
U koju sam uhvaćena
Ja sam s njim, a ti si skriveno blago
On je predanost, ti si tajni užitak
Ja sam s njim i ovo je pravi život, dušo
Izgleda da šala više nije smiješna
Ja sam s njim dok nas smrt ne rastavi
Ali to nije utjeha ovom gladnom srcu
Ja sam s njim, ali u mojoj mahnitoj glavi
Uvijek dolaziš ti i kažeš
Bi li pobjegla?
Bi li pobjegla sa mnom?
Bi li pobjegla?
Bi li pobjegla?
U ovom pravom životu nema šanse
U ovom pravom životu moram ostati
U ovom pravom životu nema šanse
U ovom pravom život

On je predanost, ti si tajni užitak
Ja sam s njim i ovo je pravi život, dušo
Izgleda da šala više nije smiješna
Ja sam s njim dok nas smrt ne rastavi
Ali to nije utjeha ovom gladnom srcu
Ja sam s njim, ali u mojoj mahnitoj glavi

Uneksin sinusta viime yönä
Heräsin, et ollut siellä
Viisi yötä peräkkäin
Unelmista, joita en ole koskaan jakanut
Saavut ilman varoitusta
Aikaisin aamulla
Ajoitus ei koskaan ole ollut meidän juttumme
Jättäen minut syyllisyyteen
Ainoa muisto, jonka tuot mukanasi
Seksi hänen kanssaan, sinä olet salainen aarre
Hän on omistautumista, sinä olet syyllinen nautinto
Olen hänen kanssaan, ja tämä on todellinen elämä, kulta
Arvaa, että vitsi ei enää ole hauska
Olen hänen kanssaan, kunnes kuolema meidät erottaa
Mutta se ei riitä tälle nälkäiselle sydämelle
Olen hänen kanssaan, mutta levottomassa päässäni
Sinä tulet aina ja sanot
Juoksisitko karkuun?
Juoksisitko karkuun kanssani?
Juoksisitko karkuun?
Juoksisitko karkuun?
Yksi rakkaus riittää
Se on kaikki mitä koskaan saat
Vähintään niin he sinulle kertovat
Silti, en voi unohtaa
Silmät kuin palavat tuhkat
Kunnes auringonsäteet välähtävät
En muista mitä minulle on opetettu
Lumoutunut ukonilmasta
Johon olen joutunut
Seksi hänen kanssaan, sinä olet salainen aarre
Hän on omistautumista, sinä olet syyllinen nautinto
Olen hänen kanssaan, ja tämä on todellinen elämä, kulta
Arvaa, että vitsi ei enää ole hauska
Olen hänen kanssaan, kunnes kuolema meidät erottaa
Mutta se ei riitä tälle nälkäiselle sydämelle
Olen hänen kanssaan, mutta levottomassa päässäni
Sinä tulet aina ja sanot
Juoksisitko karkuun?
Juoksisitko karkuun kanssani?
Juoksisitko karkuun?

Olen hänen kanssaan, kunnes kuolema meidät erottaa

Olen hänen kanssaan, mutta levottomassa päässäni

Elämän taistelu
On suurenou kuin tiedät
Itsekäs asenne on unohtumaton
Ilmaa kaikki tarvitsee
Ilmaa kaikki hengittää
He kuolevat ilman sitä
Se on anteeksiantamatonta
Hengitä, hengitä
Taistele henkesi edestä
Hengitä, hengitä
Mene nukkumaan ja unolmoi että me
Että me synnytään uudelleen
Taas sielut löytävät itsensä
Myrskyn hiessä
Ei, Ei mikään tunnu samalta
Pelko ei jätä sinua rauhaa

Emme voi menettää niitä
Meidän pitää pelastaa ne
Se on Anteeksiantamatonta
Hengitä, hengitä
Taistele henkesi edestä
Sinun pitää hengittää

Ο πόνος θα φύγει, λένε
Στον αφρό του σύννεφου
Θα κρατήσεις τα πράγματα για να νιώσεις τη μυρωδιά τους
Απλά για να ζεσταθείς
Όχι, τίποτα δεν νιώθει το ίδιο
Ο φόβος δεν θα σε αφήσει έτσι κι αλλιώς
Η μάχη για τη ζωή
Είναι μεγαλύτερο από όσο ξέρεις
Το να ενεργείς τόσο εγωιστικά είναι ασυγχώρητο
Ο αέρας είναι αυτό που χρειάζονται
Ο αέρας είναι αυτό που αναπνέουν
Θα πεθάνουν χωρίς αυτό
Είναι ασυγχώρητο
Ανάπνευσαι, Ανάπνευσαι
Πάλεψε για τη ζωή σου
Ανάπνευσαι, Ανάπνευσαι
Πήγαινε για ύπνο και ονειρέψου ότι εμείς
Εμείς ξαναγεννηθούμε
Οι ψυχές μας θα ξαναβρούν τον εαυτό τους
Στον ιδρώτα της καταιγίδας
Όχι, τίποτα δεν νιώθει το ίδιο
Ο φόβος δεν θα σε αφήσει έτσι κι αλλιώς
Η μάχη για τη ζωή
Είναι μεγαλύτερο από όσο ξέρεις
Το να ενεργείς τόσο εγωιστικά είναι ασυγχώρητο
Ο αέρας είναι αυτό που χρειάζονται
Ο αέρας είναι αυτό που αναπνέουν

Είναι ασυγχώρητο
Ο αέρας είναι αυτό που χρειάζονται
Ο αέρας είναι αυτό που αναπνέουν
Θα πεθάνουν χωρίς αυτό
Είναι ασυγχώρητο
Ασυγχώρητο, συγχωρέσιμο
Τίποτα δεν θα ένιωθε το ίδιο
Ασυγχώρητο, συγχωρέσιμο
Δεν μπορούμε να τα χάσουμε
Πρέπει να τα σώσουμε
Είναι ασυγχώρητο
Ανάπνευσαι, Ανάπνευσαι
Πάλεψε για τη ζωή σου
Καλύτερα να αναπνεύσεις
Ο αέρας είναι αυτό που χρειάζονται
Ο αέρας είναι αυτό που αναπνέουν
Θα πεθάνουν χωρίς αυτό
Είναι ασυγχώρητο
Ανάπνευσαι

Да ћемо бити поново рођени
Наше душе ће се поново наћи

How simple, life goes on
Humble, that's how I feel
Sparking hot flames, holding on
Younger days run so clear
Through my mind, replaying my crime
Tearing me up, spreading fear
Obsession in my own time
What life's taken away, I'm not missing
Will I sit back and sigh?
A thunder of thoughts, I'm dismissing
Too scared to even try
And in time I've always known
I'm never in the safety zone
I took the fight, but was I right?
They were sending me to war
And in time I've always known
I'm never in the safety zone
I took the fight, but was I right?
They were sending me to war
My intention is strong and real
Only power steels my will
The illusion of safety's surreal
Don't let it go for the kill
What life's taken away, I'm not missing
Will I sit back and sigh?
A thunder of thoughts, I'm dismissing
Too scared to even try
And in time I've always known
I'm never in the safety zone
I took the fight, but was I right?
They were sending me to war
And in time I've always known
I'm never in the safety zone
I took the fight, but was I right?
They were sending me to war
I don't want to take on the pain
So, I go seek inner signs, or a calling
The more freedom I gain
The less real life I'm recalling
And in time I've always known
I'm never in the safety zone
I took the fight, but was I right?

When LPS played
Fičo was beeping again
Žvižej screwed up his solo
By then, I thought it was a good time
That you're looking away too much
This looked full of infidelity
I've been too familiar
Because I'm looking at you
When you're leaving without me on the other side
I want you
But you give the other heart away
We dance
But it's only in my dreams
No you're not coming back
I'm looking at you
When you're leaving without me on the other side
I want you
But you give the other heart away
We dance
But it's only in my dreams
No you're not coming back
They look at me from the wall pictures
They follow me every step of the way
It brings back memories
Of every heart soaked in tears
Each beat flows more slowly
You're still here
Even if you're not
That smell of yours
It wakes me up again every day
But from now on
I'm going to the disco myself
And watch the same movie
Only that I play my part
I'm looking at you
When you're leaving without me with the other side
I want you
But you give the other heart away
We dance
But it's only in my dreams
No, you're not coming, you're not coming back
You're gone, and I'm looking at you
