WORD CLOUD
- add selection for all countries, top 5 and worst 5 countries (on average) 3
--> add api call that gets top 5 and worst 5 countries on average in a specific year range

LINE GRAPH:
- add selection for Top 5 countries (on average) in addition to individual countries 4
- adjust the shown years in a better format without '

Good selection for Ranking Conparison:
- Switzerland vs Denmark shows good that they are similarily good
- Switzerland vs Germany is a good use case for rival comparison
- UK vs Austria shows good that UK is always better
- UK vs Italy shows good that we don't connect the line when they don't participate to not mislead a user

Good selections for voting clusters:
1999 - 2022 --> cluster 1 scandinavian countries
1971 - 2022 --> cluster 3 east european countries, cluster 5 west european countries (often the case in general)
in general --> germany and france often in same cluster
Best one: 3 clusters show the western european countries well!!
Voting list only shows after a number is selected
In General --> western european countries are always pretty clearly structured (e.g. 3 clusters, 1984 - 2022)

Good selection for Word CLOUD
- only ALL looks really good
- Worst 5 you can show to talk about insight, but doesn't look that nice
- year 1984 - 2006: top 5 includes light and day, worst 5 includes rain and night 
--> might imply singing about good things gives better rankings (interesting insight to talk about imo)
